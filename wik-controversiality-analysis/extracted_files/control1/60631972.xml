==Career==
The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=http://archive.fo/a0Sc2 |deadurl=no |archivedate=15 November 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=http://archive.fo/C31be |deadurl=no |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Manik featured alongside [[Ahmed Asim]], Mariyam Nazima and [[Waleedha Waleed]] in the Haajara Abdul Kareem-directed ''[[Ajaaib]]'' which marks the first film in which Manik plays the lead role. The film depicts the relationship of two exemplary wives and their respective families regardless of societal norms.&lt;ref name=Ajaaib&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/entertainment/117146 |title=Top 10 Actors in Maldives |language=Divehi|work=Haveeru |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=16 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219100014/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/entertainment/117146 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=5 March 2012 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then played a supporting role in a film directed by Ali Waheed, ''[[Kulunu]]'' starring Ismail Wajeeh and Aishath Shirani, in which Manik was featured as an advisor to a conflicted father who arranges the marriage of his only daughter to an already committed man. The same year, he starred opposite [[Hussain Sobah]], [[Jamsheedha Ahmed]] and [[Mariyam Nisha]] in [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s debut direction ''[[Fahuneyvaa]]'' (2000) which portrays the love-conflict of a man between a prominent stage performer and a deaf-mute poor girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is a masterpiece by Nahula |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |deadurl=no |archivedate=3 December 2018 |accessdate=3 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, he played the role of Zubair Ali, father of a second wife who discovers her husband's secret marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24768 |title=Nahula at her peak; aiming for 50 shows |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=1 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/12p50 |deadurl=no |archivedate=3 December 2018 |accessdate=3 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was critically appreciated by critics and was a commercial success.&lt;ref name=Fahuneyvaa&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/7801 |title=Nahula Vs Tedry: Who among the two brought a revelation to Maldivian Cinema? |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=6 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908184812/https://avas.mv/7801 |deadurl=no |archivedate=3 December 2018 |accessdate=3 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=http://archive.fo/a0Sc2 |deadurl=no |archivedate=15 November 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=http://archive.fo/C31be |deadurl=no |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Manik featured alongside [[Ahmed Asim]], [[Mariyam Nazima]] and [[Waleedha Waleed]] in the Haajara Abdul Kareem-directed ''[[Ajaaib]]'' which marks the first film in which Manik plays the lead role.

==Career==
The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=http://archive.fo/a0Sc2 |deadurl=no |archivedate=15 November 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=http://archive.fo/C31be |deadurl=no |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the Ali Musthafa-directed ''[[Umurah]]'' (1999) opposite [[Jamsheedha Ahmed]] and [[Reeko Moosa Manik]].&lt;ref name=Umurah&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv:80/dhivehi/entertainment/117464 |title=Top 10 Actresses in Malives |language=Divehi|work=Haveeru |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=23 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305014312/http://www.haveeru.com.mv:80/dhivehi/entertainment/117464 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=5 March 2012 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Manik featured alongside [[Ahmed Asim]], [[Mariyam Nazima]] and [[Waleedha Waleed]] in the Haajara Abdul Kareem-directed ''[[Ajaaib]]'' which marks the first film in which Manik plays the lead role.

==Career==
The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, he played the father of Fayaz, an ignorant husband who is deeply in love with a patient suffering from [[Congenital heart defect|congenital heart disease]] in [[Abdul Faththaah]]'s television drama series ''[[Dhoapatta]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name=dramaseries&gt;{{cite news |url=https://avas.mv/59849 |title=Where are all the drama series? |language=Divehi |work=Avas |last=Ashraf |first=Aisha |date=4 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190527043138/https://avas.mv/59849 |url-status=live |archivedate=27 May 2019 |accessdate=27 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starring alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Sheela Najeeb]] and [[Jamsheedha Ahmed]], the series centers on unrequited love and complications of a relationship within and beyond marriage.&lt;ref name=GaumeeInaamFaththaah&gt;{{cite news|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winner/418 |title=Gaumee Inaam 2004 - Abdul Faththaah Abdul Gayyoom |work=Presidency Maldives |language=Divehi |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190423052307/https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winner/418 |url-status=live |archivedate=23 April 2019 |accessdate=3 December 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the Ali Musthafa-directed ''[[Umurah]]'' (1999) opposite [[Jamsheedha Ahmed]] and [[Reeko Moosa Manik]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Top10Actresses&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv:80/dhivehi/entertainment/117464 |title=Top 10 Actresses in Malives |language=Divehi |work=Haveeru |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=23 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305014312/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/entertainment/117464 |url-status=dead |archivedate=5 March 2012 |accessdate=26 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]].

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |accessdate=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hassan Ali Manik''' professionally known as '''Koyya Hassan Manik''' (25 April 1953 ‚Äì 20 February 2021) was a Maldivian film actor and producer.

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he played the father of Fayaz, an ignorant husband who is deeply in love with a patient suffering from [[Congenital heart defect|congenital heart disease]] in [[Abdul Faththaah]]'s television drama series ''[[Dhoapatta]]''.&lt;ref name=dramaseries&gt;{{cite news |url=https://avas.mv/59849 |title=Where are all the drama series? |language=Divehi |work=Avas |last=Ashraf |first=Aisha |date=4 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190527043138/https://avas.mv/59849 |url-status=live |archivedate=27 May 2019 |access-date=27 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starring alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Sheela Najeeb]] and [[Jamsheedha Ahmed]], the series centers on unrequited love and complications of a relationship within and beyond marriage.&lt;ref name=GaumeeInaamFaththaah&gt;{{cite news|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winner/418 |title=Gaumee Inaam 2004 - Abdul Faththaah Abdul Gayyoom |work=Presidency Maldives |language=Divehi |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190423052307/https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winner/418 |url-status=live |archivedate=23 April 2019 |access-date=3 December 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he starred opposite [[Hussain Sobah]], [[Jamsheedha Ahmed]] and [[Mariyam Nisha]] in [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s debut direction ''[[Fahuneyvaa]]'' (1998) which portrays the love-conflict of a man between a prominent stage performer and a deaf-mute poor girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is a masterpiece by Nahula |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=3 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, he played the role of Zubair Ali, father of a second wife who discovers her husband's secret marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24768 |title=Nahula at her peak; aiming for 50 shows |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=1 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181203081713/https://avas.mv/24768 |url-status=live |archivedate=3 December 2018 |access-date=3 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was critically appreciated by critics and was a commercial success.&lt;ref name=Fahuneyvaa&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/7801 |title=Nahula Vs Tedry: Who among the two brought a revelation to Maldivian Cinema? |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=6 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908184812/https://avas.mv/7801 |url-status=live |archivedate=8 September 2015 |access-date=3 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the Ali Musthafa-directed ''[[Umurah]]'' (1999) opposite [[Jamsheedha Ahmed]] and [[Reeko Moosa Manik]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Top10Actresses&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv:80/dhivehi/entertainment/117464 |title=Top 10 Actresses in Malives |language=Divehi |work=Haveeru |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=23 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305014312/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/entertainment/117464 |url-status=dead |archivedate=5 March 2012 |access-date=26 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Manik featured alongside [[Ahmed Asim]], [[Mariyam Nazima]] and [[Waleedha Waleed]] in the Haajara Abdul Kareem-directed ''[[Ajaaib]]'' which marks the first film in which Manik plays the lead role.

'''Hassan Ali Manik''' professionally known as '''Koyya Hassan Manik''' (25 April 1953 ‚Äì 20 February 2021) was a Maldivian film actor and producer.

==Career==
===1989‚Äì2008: Early releases and first lead role with ''Ajaaib''===
In 1989, Najuma offered him to feature in ''Hama Mihaaru'', one of the programs aired in the [[Voice of Maldives|Dhivehi Rajjeyge Adu]], where he took part in a total of eighteen episodes in a span of three years. During this period, a friend proffered him to star in the television comedy show; ''Bakhabaru'' alongside Fibo Ahmed Manik and continued to star in the show as part of the main cast.

The Mohamed Hilmy and Ali Waheed directed film, ''[[Ihsaas]]'' was released in 1993 in which Manik starred as a guardian to an orphan boy who is being psychologically disturbed following a [[false arrest]]. This was followed by his collaboration with Yoosuf Rafeeu for his tragedy drama film ''[[Vaudhu]]'' which follows the separation of a happy couple due to the societal differences.&lt;ref name=Top10Actresses/&gt; Afterwards, he played the role of a dedicated brother who discovers the immoral relationship of his niece with one of her teachers, in [[Amjad Ibrahim]]'s debut direction ''[[Huras]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |title=Amjey is unlucky when it comes to awards |work=Raajje.mv |language=Divehi |last=Abdulla |first=Azlifa |date=7 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222120945/https://raajje.mv/news/3058 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=15 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was developed solely with the intention of winning [[Gaumee Film Awards]] though it failed to garner any award at the 2nd Gaumee Film Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name=Huras&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |title=Amjey shocked with his deserving award |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=23 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181222115816/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/10626 |url-status=live |archivedate=22 December 2018 |access-date=22 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he played the father of Fayaz, an ignorant husband who is deeply in love with a patient suffering from [[Congenital heart defect|congenital heart disease]] in [[Abdul Faththaah]]'s television drama series ''[[Dhoapatta]]''.&lt;ref name=dramaseries&gt;{{cite news |url=https://avas.mv/59849 |title=Where are all the drama series? |language=Divehi |work=Avas |last=Ashraf |first=Aisha |date=4 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190527043138/https://avas.mv/59849 |url-status=live |archivedate=27 May 2019 |access-date=27 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starring alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Sheela Najeeb]] and [[Jamsheedha Ahmed]], the series centers on unrequited love and complications of a relationship within and beyond marriage.&lt;ref name=GaumeeInaamFaththaah&gt;{{cite news|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winner/418 |title=Gaumee Inaam 2004 - Abdul Faththaah Abdul Gayyoom |work=Presidency Maldives |language=Divehi |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190423052307/https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winner/418 |url-status=live |archivedate=23 April 2019 |access-date=3 December 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he starred opposite [[Hussain Sobah]], [[Jamsheedha Ahmed]] and [[Mariyam Nisha]] in [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s debut direction ''[[Fahuneyvaa]]'' (1998) which portrays the love-conflict of a man between a prominent stage performer and a deaf-mute poor girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is a masterpiece by Nahula |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=3 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, he played the role of Zubair Ali, father of a second wife who discovers her husband's secret marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24768 |title=Nahula at her peak; aiming for 50 shows |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=1 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181203081713/https://avas.mv/24768 |url-status=live |archivedate=3 December 2018 |access-date=3 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was critically appreciated by critics and was a commercial success.&lt;ref name=Fahuneyvaa&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/7801 |title=Nahula Vs Tedry: Who among the two brought a revelation to Maldivian Cinema? |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=6 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908184812/https://avas.mv/7801 |url-status=live |archivedate=8 September 2015 |access-date=3 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the Ali Musthafa-directed ''[[Umurah]]'' (1999) opposite [[Jamsheedha Ahmed]] and [[Reeko Moosa Manik]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Top10Actresses&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv:80/dhivehi/entertainment/117464 |title=Top 10 Actresses in Malives |language=Divehi |work=Haveeru |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=23 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305014312/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/entertainment/117464 |url-status=dead |archivedate=5 March 2012 |access-date=26 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Manik featured alongside [[Ahmed Asim]], [[Mariyam Nazima]] and [[Waleedha Waleed]] in the Haajara Abdul Kareem-directed ''[[Ajaaib]]'' which marks the first film in which Manik plays the lead role.
