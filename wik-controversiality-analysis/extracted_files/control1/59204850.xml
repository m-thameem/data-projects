'''Abdulla Muaz''' is a Maldivian film actor, editor and director.

==Career==
Muaz made a brief appearance in [[Yoosuf Shafeeu]] directed horror film ''[[Edhathuru]]'' (2004) which revolves around eight friends who go on a picnic to a haunted uninhabited island and their battle for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://sun.mv/111827 |title=Soba returning to screen with &quot;Kaaku?&quot; |work=Sun |language=Divehi |last=Musthafa |first=Mohamed |date=19 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181130061619/https://sun.mv/111827 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 November 2018 |accessdate=30 November 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edhathuru&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/18535 |title=Kuda Hajja will always be a star though she fails to fulfill her dreams |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Maaha |first=Aishath |date=13 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130061630/https://avas.mv/18535 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 November 2018 |accessdate=30 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film garnered critical appreciation specially for its sound effect and was a commercial success.&lt;ref name=GFA4won&gt;{{cite news |url=https://haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/news/56402 |title=&quot;Vehey Vaarey Thereyn&quot; lifts Best Film Award with six other awards |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Ahmed |first=Fazeena |date=20 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130062142/http://webcache.dhivehi.mv/haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/news/56402 |url-status=dead |archivedate=30 November 2018 |accessdate=30 November 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moomin Fuad]] and [[Ali Shifau]]'s critically appreciated crime film ''[[Heylaa (film)|Heylaa]]'' (2006) featured Muaz as a [[drug user]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://dho.mv/baiscope/44005 |title=Fuad regrets his involvement in Happy Birthday |language=Divehi |work=Dho?

'''Abdulla Muaz''' is a Maldivian film actor, editor and director.

==Career==
Muaz made a brief appearance in [[Yoosuf Shafeeu]] directed horror film ''[[Edhathuru]]'' (2004) which revolves around eight friends who go on a picnic to a haunted uninhabited island and their battle for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://sun.mv/111827 |title=Soba returning to screen with &quot;Kaaku?&quot; |work=Sun |language=Divehi |last=Musthafa |first=Mohamed |date=19 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20181130061619/https://sun.mv/111827 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 November 2018 |access-date=30 November 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edhathuru&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/18535 |title=Kuda Hajja will always be a star though she fails to fulfill her dreams |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Maaha |first=Aishath |date=13 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130061630/https://avas.mv/18535 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 November 2018 |access-date=30 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film garnered critical appreciation specially for its sound effect and was a commercial success.&lt;ref name=GFA4won&gt;{{cite news |url=https://haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/news/56402 |title=&quot;Vehey Vaarey Thereyn&quot; lifts Best Film Award with six other awards |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Ahmed |first=Fazeena |date=20 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130062142/http://webcache.dhivehi.mv/haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/news/56402 |url-status=dead |archivedate=30 November 2018 |access-date=30 November 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moomin Fuad]] and [[Ali Shifau]]'s critically appreciated crime film ''[[Heylaa (film)|Heylaa]]'' (2006) featured Muaz as a [[drug user]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://dho.mv/baiscope/44005 |title=Fuad regrets his involvement in Happy Birthday |language=Divehi |work=Dho?
