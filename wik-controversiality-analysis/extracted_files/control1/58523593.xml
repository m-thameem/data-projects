The last release of 2010, featured Fareela in [[Yoosuf Shafeeu]]'s drama film ''[[Heyonuvaane]]'' (2010), opposite Shafeeu and [[Sheela Najeeb]].&lt;ref name=Heyonuvaane&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/4101 |title=&quot;Heyonuvaane&quot; shouldnt be missed |language=Dhivehi |work=Sun |last=Naaif |first=Ahmed |date=27 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929062532/https://archive.mv/dv/articles/wkep |deadurl=yes |archivedate=28 September 2018 |accessdate=28 September 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story revolves around a male who is victimised of domestic abuse.&lt;ref name=Heyonuvaane/&gt; She played the role of Dr. Rizna Zareer, who meets her lover after six years settled with a marriage.&lt;ref name=HeyonuvaaneReview/&gt; The film received majorly negative reviews from critics though her performance was commended.&lt;ref name=HeyonuvaaneReview&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/4544 |title=&quot;Heyonuvaane&quot;: Year's most boring film|language=Dhivehi |work=Sun |last=Naaif |first=Ahmed |date=17 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929063548/https://archive.mv/dv/articles/dKRr |deadurl=yes |archivedate=26 September 2018 |accessdate=26 September 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty two housefull shows of the film were screened at cinema, declaring it a Mega-Hit and second highest grossing Maldivian release of the year.&lt;ref name=HeyonuvaaneDVD&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/12004 |title=&quot;Heyonuvaane&quot; DVD releasing on coming Tuesday |language=Dhivehi |work=Sun |last=Raaniya |first=Mariyam |date=24 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929064751/https://archive.mv/dv/articles/2BRk |deadurl=yes |archivedate=28 September 2018 |accessdate=28 September 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fareela began 2011 with Amjad Ibrahim's suspense thriller film ''Hafaraaiy'' alongside Ali Shameel, Mariyam Shakeela, [[Yoosuf Shafeeu]] and Amira Ismail, which was a critical and commercial failure.&lt;ref name=Hafaraaiy/&gt; Based on a real incidence, the film narrates a story of a cannibal woman who is addicted to [[Human cannibalism|eats human flesh]], how she victimised the inhabitants with her face covered in a veil.&lt;ref name=Hafaraaiy/&gt; The film received criticism for its &quot;fragile&quot; plot, &quot;unnecessary&quot; characters though its makeup was appreciated.&lt;ref name=Hafaraaiy/&gt; Ahmed Naif from ''Sun'' wrote: &quot;neither scientifically nor psychologically, its been proven in the film how a chicken addict turns to be a cannibal.

Fareela began 2011 with Amjad Ibrahim's suspense thriller film ''Hafaraaiy'' alongside Ali Shameel, Mariyam Shakeela, [[Yoosuf Shafeeu]] and [[Amira Ismail]], which was a critical and commercial failure.&lt;ref name=Hafaraaiy/&gt; Based on a real incidence, the film narrates a story of a cannibal woman who is addicted to [[Human cannibalism|eats human flesh]], how she victimised the inhabitants with her face covered in a veil.&lt;ref name=Hafaraaiy/&gt; The film received criticism for its &quot;fragile&quot; plot, &quot;unnecessary&quot; characters though its makeup was appreciated.&lt;ref name=Hafaraaiy/&gt; Ahmed Naif from ''Sun'' wrote: &quot;neither scientifically nor psychologically, its been proven in the film how a chicken addict turns to be a cannibal.

Fareela began 2011 with Amjad Ibrahim's suspense thriller film ''Hafaraaiy'' alongside [[Ali Shameel]], [[Mariyam Shakeela (actress)|Mariyam Shakeela]], [[Yoosuf Shafeeu]] and [[Amira Ismail]], which was a critical and commercial failure.&lt;ref name=Hafaraaiy/&gt; Based on a real incidence, the film narrates a story of a cannibal woman who is addicted to [[Human cannibalism|eats human flesh]], how she victimised the inhabitants with her face covered in a veil.&lt;ref name=Hafaraaiy/&gt; The film received criticism for its &quot;fragile&quot; plot, &quot;unnecessary&quot; characters though its makeup was appreciated.&lt;ref name=Hafaraaiy/&gt; Ahmed Naif from ''Sun'' wrote: &quot;neither scientifically nor psychologically, it has been proven in the film how a chicken addict turns to be a cannibal.
