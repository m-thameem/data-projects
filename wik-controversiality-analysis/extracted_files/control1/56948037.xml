===2017–present: Commercial success===

Azifa's first release of 2017 came in the Ali Musthafa-directed family drama ''[[Malikaa (film)|Malikaa]]''.&lt;ref name=malikaa&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/11594 |title=Malika Releasing on March 2 |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=13 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326140615/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/11594|archivedate=26 March 2018 |accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring [[Nuzuhath Shuaib]] and [[Mohamed Jumayyil]] in the lead role, the film tells the story of the sidelined daughter, played by Shuaib, who manages the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/29543 |title=Malikaa is not a copy of Bhaghban |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=14 February 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417154858/https://avas.mv/29543 |archivedate=17 April 2018 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azifa played the role of Jeeza, the envious and insecure sister-in-law of the title character, showing an excessive interest in acquiring money and wealth. Ahmed Nadheem, revieweing for ''Avas'' opined that Azifa was the only star who &quot;left an impression in the acting department&quot; from the film, though he felt the &quot;flaws in her character development led to lack of exhilaration&quot; at her presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/30264 |title=Family's shadow being cast over Malika |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=4 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417155710/https://avas.mv/30264 |archivedate=17 April 2018 |accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite low expectations from trade analysts, the film received mixed reviews and performed moderately at the box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;2017review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/28542 |title=2017: Is it a successful year for the film industry? |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=31 December 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326162251/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/28542 |archivedate=26 March 2018 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/29805 |title=Malika is a commercial success, watch out for the red carpet |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=20 February 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417155914/https://avas.mv/29805 |archivedate=17 April 2018 |accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She next featured alongside an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Yoosuf Shafeeu]], [[Mohamed Manik]], [[Ahmed Saeed (actor)|Ahmed Saeed]] and [[Ali Seezan]] in the romantic comedy film ''[[Naughty 40 (film)|Naughty 40]]'' which was directed by Shafeeu.&lt;ref name=&quot;naught40&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/12917 |title=&quot;Naughty 40&quot; featuring notable celebrities launched |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=13 February 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326152524/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/12917 |archivedate=26 March 2018 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film revolves around three friends, Ashwanee, Ahsan and Ajwad (Played by Shafeeu, Saeed and Manik respectively) who are single and having a youthful outlook, in spite of being in their forties.&lt;ref name=&quot;naught40&quot;/&gt; Azifa played the role of Taniya, the beguiling lady signed up by her aunt to seduce and take down their rival businessman in the island, Jawad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/92991 |title=&quot;Naughty 40&quot; premiered; as promised it has all tastes|language=Divehi|work=Sun |last=Reehan |first=Mohamed |date=3 August 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417163132/https://sun.mv/api/getcomments/?art=92991&amp;rep=0&amp;highlight= |archivedate=17 April 2018 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film met with both critical and commercial success, emerging as one of the highest grossing Maldivian films of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/36883 |title=&quot;Naughty 40&quot;: A mixture of all tastes |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Maaha |first=Aishath|date=6 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327033332/https://avas.mv/36883 |url-status=live |archive-date=27 March 2018 |access-date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2017review&quot;/&gt;

2018 was a dull year for Maldivian film-industry with regards to [[2018 Maldivian presidential election]], hence only one film of Azifa was released during the year; a [[Thriller film|suspense thriller film]] ''[[Dhevansoora]]'' (2018) written and directed by [[Yoosuf Shafeeu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/25449 |title=&quot;Dhevansoora&quot;: A suspense thriller by Eupe |language=Divehi|work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328111609/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/25449|url-status=live |archive-date=28 March 2018 |access-date=28 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film marks Shafeeu's thirtieth direction and features an [[ensemble cast]] of twenty-one actors.&lt;ref name=Dhevansoora/&gt; Revolving around a murder investigating, she played an imaginary doctor counselling the character played by Shafeeu; a man suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/96653 |title=Dhevansoora is a must watch |language=Divehi |work=Sun |last=Fareeha |first=Aishath |date=4 November 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20181120063343/https://sun.mv/96464 |url-status=live |archive-date=20 November 2018 |access-date=20 November 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received positive reviews from critics and was considered a &quot;norm-breaker&quot; for the Maldivian cinema.&lt;ref name=Dhevansoora/&gt; Ahmed Hameed Adam reviewing from VNews applauded Azifa's performance and found her to &quot;sensuous yet convincing&quot;.&lt;ref name=Dhevansoora&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/95298 |title=Dhevansoora: Re-writing History of Maldivian Cinema |language=Divehi |work=VNews |last=Adam |first=Ahmed Hameed |date=8 February 2018 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190419092414/http://vnews.mv/95298 |url-status=live |archive-date=19 April 2019 |access-date=19 April 2019 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
