In 2010, Afeefa was featured in Abdul Fahtah's horror film ''[[Jinni (film)|Jinni]]'' alongside [[Ali Seezan]].&lt;ref name=Jinni&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv:80/?page=details&amp;id=93070&amp;category=ihUfinum |title=Positive comment for the film - Its a big achievement |language=Divehi |work=Haveeru |last=Naseer |first=Ismail |date=11 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212110900/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/?page=details&amp;id=93070&amp;category=ihUfinum |url-status=dead |archivedate=12 February 2010 |accessdate=19 September 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on true incidents that occurred in an island of Maldives, she played the role of Thahumeena, a simple-going girl who romantically link ups with a visitor and a ghost who seduce the same person in the shape of Thahumeena. Prior to release the film was marketed to be &quot;full of suspense&quot; and &quot;unique&quot; compared to other mediocre Maldivian horror films. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics; majority of them complaining for having the &quot;same old feeling&quot; of prior horror flicks though the performance were noted to be satisfactory. Despite the mixed reviews, the film witnessed a positive response at the box office, screening a total of twenty two housefull shows in Male', declaring it as a Mega-Hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv:80/?page=details&amp;id=95729&amp;category=ihUfinum |title=Positive comment for the film - Its a big achievement |language=Divehi |work=Haveeru |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=29 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503053202/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/?page=details&amp;id=95729&amp;category=ihUfinum |url-status=dead |archivedate=3 May 2010 |accessdate=19 September 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Enchanteur Maldives Film Awards 2012, Afeefa received a nomination for the Best Actress category.&lt;ref name=MFA12nom&gt;{{cite news|url=http://maldivesfilmawards.com/?page=detail&amp;id=34 |title=Feature Film Nominations Announced |language=Divehi|work=Maldives Film Awards |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417013119/http://maldivesfilmawards.com/?page=detail&amp;id=34 |url-status=dead|archivedate=17 April 2016 |accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to release the film was marketed to be &quot;full of suspense&quot; and &quot;unique&quot; compared to other mediocre Maldivian horror films. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics; majority of them complaining for having the &quot;same old feeling&quot; of prior horror flicks though the performance were noted to be satisfactory. Despite the mixed reviews, the film witnessed a positive response at the box office, screening a total of twenty two housefull shows in Male', declaring it as a Mega-Hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv:80/?page=details&amp;id=95729&amp;category=ihUfinum |title=Positive comment for the film - Its a big achievement |language=Divehi |work=Haveeru |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=29 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503053202/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/?page=details&amp;id=95729&amp;category=ihUfinum |url-status=dead |archivedate=3 May 2010 |accessdate=19 September 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2nd Maldives Film Award]], Afeefa received a nomination for the Best Actress category.&lt;ref name=MFA12nom&gt;{{cite news|url=http://maldivesfilmawards.com/?page=detail&amp;id=34 |title=Feature Film Nominations Announced |language=Divehi|work=Maldives Film Awards |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417013119/http://maldivesfilmawards.com/?page=detail&amp;id=34 |url-status=dead|archivedate=17 April 2016 |accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
