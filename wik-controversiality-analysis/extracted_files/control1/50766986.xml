Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Dhivehi |work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |deadurl=no |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Dhivehi |work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |deadurl=no |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

Jumayyil was next featured in Ali Shifau-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Dhivehi |publisher=''Avas'' |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works. He further rated Jumayyil at the same level of Majudha—whom Nadheem considered as the best actor of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;unlimited praise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/15516 |title=Vaashey Mashaa Ekee: Unlimited praise |language=Dhivehi |publisher=''Avas'' |author=Nasheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606080851/https://avas.mv/15516|archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film emerged as one of the highest grossing films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |title=Upcoming releases of the year|language=Dhivehi |publisher=''Mihaaru'' |author=Adhushan, Ahmed |date=3 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606085206/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[8th Gaumee Film Awards]] Jumayyil was bestowed with [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award for ''Vaashey Mashaa Ekee'' while being nominated for ''Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen'' in the same category.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;&lt;ref name=GFA8nom/&gt; He also received the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut|Best Male Debut]] award for his performance in ''Aniya''.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with Fathimath Nahula's horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Dhivehi |work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |deadurl=no |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Dhivehi |work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |deadurl=no |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father Ahmed Nimal is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Dhivehi |publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G.

In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with Ahmed Nimal's ''Aniyaa'', alongside Niuma Mohamed, [[Ismail Rasheed]] and Fathmath Fareela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Dhivehi |publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Dhivehi |publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Dhivehi |publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Dhivehi |publisher=''Avas'' |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in Ali Shifau-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Dhivehi |publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in Ali Shifau-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Dhivehi |work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |deadurl=no |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G.

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Dhivehi |publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Dhivehi |publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Dhivehi |publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Dhivehi |publisher=''Avas'' |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in Ali Shifau-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Dhivehi |publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=''Avas'' |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in Ali Shifau-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in Ali Shifau-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=''Avas'' |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works. He further rated Jumayyil at the same level of Majudha—whom Nadheem considered as the best actor of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;unlimited praise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/15516 |title=Vaashey Mashaa Ekee: Unlimited praise |language=Divehi|publisher=''Avas'' |author=Nasheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606080851/https://avas.mv/15516|archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film emerged as one of the highest grossing films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |title=Upcoming releases of the year|language=Divehi|publisher=''Mihaaru'' |author=Adhushan, Ahmed |date=3 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606085206/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[8th Gaumee Film Awards]] Jumayyil was bestowed with [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award for ''Vaashey Mashaa Ekee'' while being nominated for ''Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen'' in the same category.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;&lt;ref name=GFA8nom/&gt; He also received the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut|Best Male Debut]] award for his performance in ''Aniya''.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with Fathimath Nahula's horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |deadurl=no |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |deadurl=no |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=''Avas'' |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in Ali Shifau-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=''Avas'' |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=''Vaguthu'' |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=''Avas'' |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works. He further rated Jumayyil at the same level of Majudha—whom Nadheem considered as the best actor of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;unlimited praise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/15516 |title=Vaashey Mashaa Ekee: Unlimited praise |language=Divehi|publisher=''Avas'' |author=Nasheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606080851/https://avas.mv/15516|archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film emerged as one of the highest grossing films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |title=Upcoming releases of the year|language=Divehi|publisher=''Mihaaru'' |author=Adhushan, Ahmed |date=3 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606085206/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[8th Gaumee Film Awards]] Jumayyil was bestowed with [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award for ''Vaashey Mashaa Ekee'' while being nominated for ''Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen'' in the same category.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;&lt;ref name=GFA8nom/&gt; He also received the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut|Best Male Debut]] award for his performance in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |deadurl=no |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |deadurl=no |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works. He further rated Jumayyil at the same level of Majudha—whom Nadheem considered as the best actor of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;unlimited praise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/15516 |title=Vaashey Mashaa Ekee: Unlimited praise |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nasheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606080851/https://avas.mv/15516|archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |title=Upcoming releases of the year|language=Divehi|publisher=Mihaaru |author=Adhushan, Ahmed |date=3 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606085206/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[8th Gaumee Film Awards]] Jumayyil was bestowed with [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award for ''Vaashey Mashaa Ekee'' while being nominated for ''Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen'' in the same category.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;&lt;ref name=GFA8nom/&gt; He also received the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut|Best Male Debut]] award for his performance in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works. He further rated Jumayyil at the same level of Majudha—whom Nadheem considered as the best actor of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;unlimited praise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/15516 |title=Vaashey Mashaa Ekee: Unlimited praise |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nasheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606080851/https://avas.mv/15516|archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |title=Upcoming releases of the year|language=Divehi|publisher=Mihaaru |author=Adhushan, Ahmed |date=3 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606085206/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[8th Gaumee Film Awards]] Jumayyil was bestowed with [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award for ''Vaashey Mashaa Ekee'' while being nominated for ''Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen'' in the same category.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;&lt;ref name=GFA8nom/&gt; He also received the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut|Best Male Debut]] award for his performance in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

Jumayyil's first release of 2019 was the Ahmed Sinan-directed crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019) which centers around the criminality and misdemeanor a young man has to deal with while trying to prove his truest intention of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/32989 |title=Goh Raalhu yet again postponed |language=Divehi |work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=20 March 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190128101708/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/32989 |url-status=live |archivedate=28 January 2019 |accessdate=28 January 2019 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/14230 |title=Goh Raalhu: Shinan's second direction |language=Divehi |work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=13 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190128074915/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/14230 |url-status=live |archivedate=28 January 2019 |accessdate=28 January 2019 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received widespread positive reviews from critics; Aminath Luba of ''Sun'' called it a &quot;five-star worthy blockbuster film&quot; and wrote: &quot;Jumayyil yet again proved that he is here to stay and entertain the audience with his authentic performance, no matter what the genre is&quot;.&lt;ref name=GohRaalhuReview&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/115066 |title=Goh Raalhu Review: Drowned in the wave of Goh Raalhu |language=Divehi |work=Sun |last=Luba |first=Aminath |date=16 February 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190523164142/https://sun.mv/115066 |url-status=live |archivedate=23 May 2019 |accessdate=23 May 2019 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotyped in a romantic avatar, several reviews and comments suggest that Jumayyil is more preferable in the crime related roles.&lt;ref name=GohRaalhuReview/&gt;

==Controversy==
In December 2016, Jumayyil was under investigation on allegations of raping two of his female relatives.&lt;ref name=porn/&gt; The Prosecutor General's Office revealed that charges of sexual assault were not pressed against him as a result of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name=evidence&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.mv/news/17646 |title=Actor Jumayyil prosecuted for keeping porn on phone, tablet |work=The Edition |last=Malsa |first=Mariyam |date=3 July 2020  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705043948/https://edition.mv/news/17646 |url-status=live |archivedate=5 July 2020 |accessdate=5 July 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations regarding the sexual abuse resurfaced in July 2020 after one of the victim, aged 17 at the time of the abuse, publicly shared a detailed account of the harassment.&lt;ref name=evidence/&gt; As a result, production company [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] removed him from all pending projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/81873 |title=Maldivian actor accused of rape, dropped from all pending projects |work=Raajje.mv |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=3 July 2020 |archiveurl=http://archive.vn/wip/Q7Ot4 |url-status=live |archivedate=20 August 2020 |accessdate=20 August 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works. He further rated Jumayyil at the same level of Majudha—whom Nadheem considered as the best actor of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;unlimited praise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/15516 |title=Vaashey Mashaa Ekee: Unlimited praise |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nasheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606080851/https://avas.mv/15516|archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |title=Upcoming releases of the year|language=Divehi|publisher=Mihaaru |author=Adhushan, Ahmed |date=3 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606085206/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[8th Gaumee Film Awards]] Jumayyil was bestowed with [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award for ''Vaashey Mashaa Ekee'' while being nominated for ''Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen'' in the same category.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;&lt;ref name=GFA8nom/&gt; He also received the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut|Best Male Debut]] award for his performance in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

Jumayyil's first release of 2019 was the Ahmed Sinan-directed crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019) which centers around the criminality and misdemeanor a young man has to deal with while trying to prove his truest intention of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/32989 |title=Goh Raalhu yet again postponed |language=Divehi |work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=20 March 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190128101708/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/32989 |url-status=live |archivedate=28 January 2019 |accessdate=28 January 2019 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/14230 |title=Goh Raalhu: Shinan's second direction |language=Divehi |work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=13 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190128074915/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/14230 |url-status=live |archivedate=28 January 2019 |accessdate=28 January 2019 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received widespread positive reviews from critics; Aminath Luba of ''Sun'' called it a &quot;five-star worthy blockbuster film&quot; and wrote: &quot;Jumayyil yet again proved that he is here to stay and entertain the audience with his authentic performance, no matter what the genre is&quot;.&lt;ref name=GohRaalhuReview&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/115066 |title=Goh Raalhu Review: Drowned in the wave of Goh Raalhu |language=Divehi |work=Sun |last=Luba |first=Aminath |date=16 February 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190523164142/https://sun.mv/115066 |url-status=live |archivedate=23 May 2019 |accessdate=23 May 2019 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotyped in a romantic avatar, several reviews and comments suggest that Jumayyil is more preferable in the crime related roles.&lt;ref name=GohRaalhuReview/&gt;

==Controversy==
In December 2016, Jumayyil was under investigation on allegations of raping two of his female relatives.&lt;ref name=porn/&gt; The Prosecutor General's Office revealed that charges of sexual assault were not pressed against him as a result of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name=evidence&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.mv/news/17646 |title=Actor Jumayyil prosecuted for keeping porn on phone, tablet |work=The Edition |last=Malsa |first=Mariyam |date=3 July 2020  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705043948/https://edition.mv/news/17646 |url-status=live |archivedate=5 July 2020 |accessdate=5 July 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations regarding the sexual abuse resurfaced in July 2020 after one of the victim, aged 17 at the time of the abuse, publicly shared a detailed account of the harassment.&lt;ref name=evidence/&gt; As a result, production company [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] removed him from all pending projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/81873 |title=Maldivian actor accused of rape, dropped from all pending projects |work=Raajje.mv |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=3 July 2020 |archiveurl=http://archive.vn/wip/Q7Ot4 |url-status=live |archivedate=20 August 2020 |accessdate=20 August 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works. He further rated Jumayyil at the same level of Majudha—whom Nadheem considered as the best actor of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;unlimited praise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/15516 |title=Vaashey Mashaa Ekee: Unlimited praise |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nasheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606080851/https://avas.mv/15516|archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |title=Upcoming releases of the year|language=Divehi|publisher=Mihaaru |author=Adhushan, Ahmed |date=3 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606085206/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[8th Gaumee Film Awards]] Jumayyil was bestowed with [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award for ''Vaashey Mashaa Ekee'' while being nominated for ''Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen'' in the same category.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;&lt;ref name=GFA8nom/&gt; He also received the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut|Best Male Debut]] award for his performance in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

Jumayyil's first release of 2019 was the Ahmed Sinan-directed crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019) which centers around the criminality and misdemeanor a young man has to deal with while trying to prove his truest intention of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/32989 |title=Goh Raalhu yet again postponed |language=Divehi |work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=20 March 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190128101708/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/32989 |url-status=live |archivedate=28 January 2019 |accessdate=28 January 2019 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/14230 |title=Goh Raalhu: Shinan's second direction |language=Divehi |work=Mihaaru |last=Adhushan |first=Ahmed |date=13 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190128074915/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/14230 |url-status=live |archivedate=28 January 2019 |accessdate=28 January 2019 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received widespread positive reviews from critics; Aminath Luba of ''Sun'' called it a &quot;five-star worthy blockbuster film&quot; and wrote: &quot;Jumayyil yet again proved that he is here to stay and entertain the audience with his authentic performance, no matter what the genre is&quot;.&lt;ref name=GohRaalhuReview&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/115066 |title=Goh Raalhu Review: Drowned in the wave of Goh Raalhu |language=Divehi |work=Sun |last=Luba |first=Aminath |date=16 February 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190523164142/https://sun.mv/115066 |url-status=live |archivedate=23 May 2019 |accessdate=23 May 2019 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotyped in a romantic avatar, several reviews and comments suggest that Jumayyil is more preferable in the crime related roles.&lt;ref name=GohRaalhuReview/&gt;

==Controversy==
In December 2016, Jumayyil was under investigation on allegations of raping two of his female relatives.&lt;ref name=porn/&gt; The Prosecutor General's Office revealed that charges of sexual assault were not pressed against him as a result of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name=evidence&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.mv/news/17646 |title=Actor Jumayyil prosecuted for keeping porn on phone, tablet |work=The Edition |last=Malsa |first=Mariyam |date=3 July 2020  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705043948/https://edition.mv/news/17646 |url-status=live |archivedate=5 July 2020 |accessdate=5 July 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations regarding the sexual abuse resurfaced in July 2020 after one of the victim, aged 17 at the time of the abuse, publicly shared a detailed account of the harassment.&lt;ref name=evidence/&gt; As a result, production company [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] removed him from all pending projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/81873 |title=Maldivian actor accused of rape, dropped from all pending projects |work=Raajje.mv |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=3 July 2020 |archiveurl=http://archive.vn/wip/Q7Ot4 |url-status=live |archivedate=20 August 2020 |accessdate=20 August 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2017, a case was filed against Jumayyil at Criminal Court for keeping pornographic material on his phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://en.sun.mv/48354 |title=Jumayyil charged with porn possession |work=Actor Jumayyil prosecuted for keeping porn on phone, tablet |date=18 April 2018 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/wip/BvEML |url-status=live |archivedate=20 August 2020 |accessdate=20 August 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, he was charged with possession of pornography, however, was freed on bail when summoned to court for a remand hearing.&lt;ref name=porn&gt;{{cite news|url=https://maldivesindependent.com/crime-2/jumayyil-charged-with-porn-possession-137565 |title=Jumayyil charged with porn possession |work=Maldives Independent |date=18 April 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820104951/https://maldivesindependent.com/crime-2/jumayyil-charged-with-porn-possession-137565 |url-status=live |archivedate=20 August 2020 |accessdate=20 August 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Jumayyil was arrested from a cafe in Malé on suspicion of consuming and possessing alcohol.&lt;ref name=porn/&gt;

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works. He further rated Jumayyil at the same level of Majudha—whom Nadheem considered as the best actor of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;unlimited praise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/15516 |title=Vaashey Mashaa Ekee: Unlimited praise |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nasheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606080851/https://avas.mv/15516|archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |title=Upcoming releases of the year|language=Divehi|publisher=Mihaaru |author=Adhushan, Ahmed |date=3 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606085206/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[8th Gaumee Film Awards]] Jumayyil was bestowed with [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award for ''Vaashey Mashaa Ekee'' while being nominated for ''Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen'' in the same category.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;&lt;ref name=GFA8nom/&gt; He also received the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut|Best Male Debut]] award for his performance in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Controversy==
In December 2016, Jumayyil was under investigation on allegations of raping two of his female relatives.&lt;ref name=porn/&gt; The Prosecutor General's Office revealed that charges of sexual assault were not pressed against him as a result of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name=evidence&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.mv/news/17646 |title=Actor Jumayyil prosecuted for keeping porn on phone, tablet |work=The Edition |last=Malsa |first=Mariyam |date=3 July 2020  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705043948/https://edition.mv/news/17646 |url-status=live |archivedate=5 July 2020 |accessdate=5 July 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations regarding the sexual abuse resurfaced in July 2020 after one of the victim, aged 17 at the time of the abuse, publicly shared a detailed account of the harassment.&lt;ref name=evidence/&gt; As a result, production company [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] removed him from all pending projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/81873 |title=Maldivian actor accused of rape, dropped from all pending projects |work=Raajje.mv |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=3 July 2020 |archiveurl=http://archive.vn/wip/Q7Ot4 |url-status=live |archivedate=20 August 2020 |accessdate=20 August 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution.

During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G.

During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution.

During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor and a rapist.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution.

During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G.

In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film.

During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G.

In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

In December 2016, Jumayyil was under investigation on allegations of raping two of his female relatives.&lt;ref name=porn/&gt; The Prosecutor General's Office revealed that charges of sexual assault were not pressed against him as a result of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name=evidence&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.mv/news/17646 |title=Actor Jumayyil prosecuted for keeping porn on phone, tablet |work=The Edition |last=Malsa |first=Mariyam |date=3 July 2020  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705043948/https://edition.mv/news/17646 |url-status=live |archivedate=5 July 2020 |accessdate=5 July 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations regarding the sexual abuse resurfaced in July 2020 after one of the victim, aged 17 at the time of the abuse, publicly shared a detailed account of the harassment.&lt;ref name=evidence/&gt; As a result, production company [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] removed him from all pending projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/81873 |title=Maldivian actor accused of rape, dropped from all pending projects |work=Raajje.mv |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=3 July 2020 |archiveurl=http://archive.vn/wip/Q7Ot4 |url-status=live |archivedate=20 August 2020 |accessdate=20 August 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works. He further rated Jumayyil at the same level of Majudha—whom Nadheem considered as the best actor of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;unlimited praise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/15516 |title=Vaashey Mashaa Ekee: Unlimited praise |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nasheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606080851/https://avas.mv/15516|archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |title=Upcoming releases of the year|language=Divehi|publisher=Mihaaru |author=Adhushan, Ahmed |date=3 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606085206/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[8th Gaumee Film Awards]] Jumayyil was bestowed with [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award for ''Vaashey Mashaa Ekee'' while being nominated for ''Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen'' in the same category.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;&lt;ref name=GFA8nom/&gt; He also received the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut|Best Male Debut]] award for his performance in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Controversy==
In December 2016, Jumayyil was under investigation on allegations of raping two of his female relatives.&lt;ref name=porn/&gt; The Prosecutor General's Office revealed that charges of sexual assault were not pressed against him as a result of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name=evidence&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.mv/news/17646 |title=Actor Jumayyil prosecuted for keeping porn on phone, tablet |work=The Edition |last=Malsa |first=Mariyam |date=3 July 2020  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705043948/https://edition.mv/news/17646 |url-status=live |archivedate=5 July 2020 |accessdate=5 July 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations regarding the sexual abuse resurfaced in July 2020 after one of the victim, aged 17 at the time of the abuse, publicly shared a detailed account of the harassment.&lt;ref name=evidence/&gt; As a result, production company [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] removed him from all pending projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://raajje.mv/81873 |title=Maldivian actor accused of rape, dropped from all pending projects |work=Raajje.mv |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=3 July 2020 |archiveurl=http://archive.vn/wip/Q7Ot4 |url-status=live |archivedate=20 August 2020 |accessdate=20 August 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution.

During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works. He further rated Jumayyil at the same level of Majudha—whom Nadheem considered as the best actor of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;unlimited praise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/15516 |title=Vaashey Mashaa Ekee: Unlimited praise |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nasheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606080851/https://avas.mv/15516|archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |title=Upcoming releases of the year|language=Divehi|publisher=Mihaaru |author=Adhushan, Ahmed |date=3 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606085206/https://mihaaru.com/entertainment/876 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[8th Gaumee Film Awards]] Jumayyil was bestowed with [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award for ''Vaashey Mashaa Ekee'' while being nominated for ''Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen'' in the same category.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;&lt;ref name=GFA8nom/&gt; He also received the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut|Best Male Debut]] award for his performance in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=GFA8win/&gt;

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution.

In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution.

During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor. He is the son of actor [[Ahmed Nimal]]

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor. He is the son of actor [[Ahmed Nimal]]

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor. He is the son of actor [[Ahmed Nimal]]

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor. He is the son of actor [[Ahmed Nimal]]

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha.

Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

==Controversy==
In December 2016, Jumayyil was under investigation on allegations of raping two of his female relatives.&lt;ref name=porn/&gt; The Prosecutor General's Office revealed that charges of sexual assault were not pressed against him as a result of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name=evidence&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.mv/news/17646 |title=Actor Jumayyil prosecuted for keeping porn on phone, tablet |work=The Edition |last=Malsa |first=Mariyam |date=3 July 2020  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705043948/https://edition.mv/news/17646 |url-status=live |archivedate=5 July 2020 |accessdate=5 July 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations regarding the sexual abuse resurfaced in July 2020 after one of the victim, aged 17 at the time of the abuse, publicly shared a detailed account of the harassment.&lt;ref name=evidence/&gt; As a result, production company [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] removed him from all pending projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://raajje.mv/81873 |title=Maldivian actor accused of rape, dropped from all pending projects |work=Raajje.mv |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=3 July 2020 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200820110753/https://raajje.mv/81873 |url-status=live |archivedate=20 August 2020 |accessdate=20 August 2020 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor. He is the son of actor [[Ahmed Nimal]]

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil''' is a Maldivian actor. He is the son of actor [[Ahmed Nimal]]

==Early life==
Mohamed Jumayyil's father [[Ahmed Nimal]] is one of the established actor and director of the industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; Jumayyil went to [[Ahmadhiyya International School|Ahmadiyya Pre-school]] as his first institution. He completed his primary education at Jamaluddin School before completing his secondary education at [[Dharumavantha School]].&lt;ref name=football&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |title=Former Football Player, Now a talented actor |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Maahaa, Aishath |date=26 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610085522/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/arts/291732/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exams, Nimal, inclined Jumayyil to persuade a career in film industry.&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He then offered a chance to act in one of his directed films due to his interest for acting in films. During the time, he was a football player at [[B.G. Sports Club]].&lt;ref name=football/&gt; He also worked at [[Singapore Airlines Cargo]], before shifting his job and working as an [[Airport check-in]] staff.&lt;ref name=football/&gt;

==Career==
In 2014, Jumayyil made his film debut with [[Ahmed Nimal]]'s ''[[Aniyaa]]'', alongside [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Ismail Rasheed]] and [[Fathimath Fareela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://addulive.com/05113572013 |title=Jumayyyil is being launched to the industry with &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Addu Live |author=Faisal, Ibrahim |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first release&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vnews.mv/18164 |title=First release of the year &quot;Aniyaa&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vnews |author=Ali, Safoora |date=29 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172231/http://vnews.mv/18164 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to some struggle caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. Despite doing average business, Jumayyil's character was met with mixed to positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |title=&quot;Aniyaa&quot; and &quot;Ran Dhari&quot; released |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=25 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609171910/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/276537/ |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/2873 |title=Posters of &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;not upto mark |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=9 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609172519/https://avas.mv/2873 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film along with Jumayyil's acting was critically acclaimed. In a pre-premiere review from ''Vaguthu'', Ismail Nail praised Jumayyil and Majudha's chemistry in the film and mentioned how he has improved compared to his work in ''[[Aniyaa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFVJ review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |title=Pre-premiere Review: &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; A new benchmark to romantic films |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=5 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083407/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/review/253783/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the highest-grossing film of the year, and was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |title=Unlimited compliments for &quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083616/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/255964/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumayyil was next featured in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]]'' (2016) opposite Majudha. In the film, he played the role of Ziyad, a person with a very different taste of his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.avas.mv/12504 |title=A new Film, A new Lover, A new Jumayyil |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=8 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609164655/https://www.avas.mv/12504 |archivedate=9 June 2016 |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance was positively mentioned in the reviews, Ahmed Nadheem from ''Avas'' picked Jumayyil as the only actor who has shown a major improvement in acting compared to his previous works.

Jumayyil's another release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Suja, a member of the friends who gets trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but he found Jumayyil to be &quot;average&quot; performing in the role.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |accessdate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

After completing his education, Nimal encouraged him to consider a career in the film industry and offered him to play a role in his family drama ''[[Aniyaa]]'', which earned him a [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut]]. Subsequently, he caught the attention of [[Dark Rain Entertainment]], leading to significant roles in their romantic films including ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' (2015) and [[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]] (2016), both of which secured him nominations for the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor]], ultimately winning the award for the latter.

Jumayyil's collaboration with [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] continued with a series of romantic comedies, including ''[[Mee Loaybakee]]'' (2017) and ''[[Vakin Loabin]]'' (2018). He later diversified his repertoire by exploring different genres including the crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019), anthology crime web series ''[[Hatharu Halha]]'' and the comedy film ''[[Maamui]]'' (2019).

'''Mohamed Jumayyil Nimal''' (born 19 April 1989) is a Maldivian actor. He has established a career in Maldives Film Industry and is a recipient of several awards, including two [[Gaumee Film Awards]].

Born in [[Malé]], Jumayyil is the son of the renowned Maldivian film actor and director [[Ahmed Nimal]]. After completing his education, Nimal encouraged him to consider a career in the film industry and offered him to play a role in his family drama ''[[Aniyaa]]'', which earned him a [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut]]. Subsequently, he caught the attention of [[Dark Rain Entertainment]], leading to significant roles in their romantic films including ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' (2015) and [[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]] (2016), both of which secured him nominations for the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor]], ultimately winning the award for the latter.

Jumayyil's collaboration with [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] continued with a series of romantic comedies, including ''[[Mee Loaybakee]]'' (2017) and ''[[Vakin Loabin]]'' (2018). He later diversified his repertoire by exploring different genres including the crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019), anthology crime web series ''[[Hatharu Halha]]'' and the comedy film ''[[Maamui]]'' (2019). Following controversies related to his personal life, he had experienced changes in his project lineup, with limited film releases.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil Nimal''' (born 19 April 1989) is a Maldivian actor. He has established a career in Maldives Film Industry and is a recipient of several awards, including two [[Gaumee Film Awards]].

Born in [[Malé]], Jumayyil is the son of the renowned Maldivian film actor and director [[Ahmed Nimal]]. After completing his education, Nimal encouraged him to consider a career in the film industry and offered him to play a role in his family drama ''[[Aniyaa]]'', which earned him a [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut]]. Subsequently, he caught the attention of [[Dark Rain Entertainment]], leading to significant roles in their romantic films including ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' (2015) and [[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]] (2016), both of which secured him nominations for the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor]], ultimately winning the award for the latter.

Jumayyil's collaboration with [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] continued with a series of romantic comedies, including ''[[Mee Loaybakee]]'' (2017) and ''[[Vakin Loabin]]'' (2018). He later diversified his repertoire by exploring different genres including the crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019), anthology crime web series ''[[Hatharu Halha]]'' and the comedy film ''[[Maamui]]'' (2019). Following controversies related to his personal life, he had experienced changes in his project lineup, with limited film releases.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil Nimal''' (born 19 April 1989) is a Maldivian actor and rapist . He has established a career in Maldives Film Industry and is a recipient of several awards, including two [[Gaumee Film Awards]].

Born in [[Malé]], Jumayyil is the son of the renowned Maldivian film actor and director [[Ahmed Nimal]]. After completing his education, Nimal encouraged him to consider a career in the film industry and offered him to play a role in his family drama ''[[Aniyaa]]'', which earned him a [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut]]. Subsequently, he caught the attention of [[Dark Rain Entertainment]], leading to significant roles in their romantic films including ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' (2015) and [[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]] (2016), both of which secured him nominations for the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor]], ultimately winning the award for the latter.

Jumayyil's collaboration with [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] continued with a series of romantic comedies, including ''[[Mee Loaybakee]]'' (2017) and ''[[Vakin Loabin]]'' (2018). He later diversified his repertoire by exploring different genres including the crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019), anthology crime web series ''[[Hatharu Halha]]'' and the comedy film ''[[Maamui]]'' (2019). Following controversies related to his personal life, he had experienced changes in his project lineup, with limited film releases.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil Nimal''' (born 19 April 1989) is a Maldivian actor. He has established a career in Maldives Film Industry and is a recipient of several awards, including two [[Gaumee Film Awards]].

Born in [[Malé]], Jumayyil is the son of the renowned Maldivian film actor and director [[Ahmed Nimal]]. After completing his education, Nimal encouraged him to consider a career in the film industry and offered him to play a role in his family drama ''[[Aniyaa]]'', which earned him a [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut]]. Subsequently, he caught the attention of [[Dark Rain Entertainment]], leading to significant roles in their romantic films including ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' (2015) and [[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]] (2016), both of which secured him nominations for the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor]], ultimately winning the award for the latter.

Jumayyil's collaboration with [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] continued with a series of romantic comedies, including ''[[Mee Loaybakee]]'' (2017) and ''[[Vakin Loabin]]'' (2018). He later diversified his repertoire by exploring different genres including the crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019), anthology crime web series ''[[Hatharu Halha]]'' and the comedy film ''[[Maamui]]'' (2019). Following controversies related to his personal life, he had experienced changes in his project lineup, with limited film releases.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil Nimal''' (born 19 April 1989) is a Maldivian actor. He has established a career in Maldives Film Industry and is a recipient of several awards, including two [[Gaumee Film Awards]].

Born in [[Malé]], Jumayyil is the son of the renowned Maldivian film actor and director [[Ahmed Nimal]]. After completing his education, Nimal encouraged him to consider a career in the film industry and offered him to play a role in his family drama ''[[Aniyaa]]'', which earned him a [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut]]. Subsequently, he caught the attention of [[Dark Rain Entertainment]], leading to significant roles in their romantic films including ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' (2015) and [[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]] (2016), both of which secured him nominations for the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor]], ultimately winning the award for the latter.

Jumayyil's collaboration with [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] continued with a series of romantic comedies, including ''[[Mee Loaybakee]]'' (2017) and ''[[Vakin Loabin]]'' (2018). He later diversified his repertoire by exploring different genres including the crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019), anthology crime web series ''[[Hatharu Halha]]'' and the comedy film ''[[Maamui]]'' (2019). Following controversies related to his personal life, he had experienced changes in his project lineup, with limited film releases.

The subsequent year, Jumayyil appeared in [[Ali Shifau]]-directed romantic film ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' opposite [[Mariyam Majudha]], where he portrayed the role of Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |title=&quot;Emme Fahu Vindhaa Jehendhen&quot;: A big success with repeat audience |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Naail, Ismail |date=7 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610083108/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/maldives-film-industry/254622/ |archivedate=10 June 2016 |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received critical acclaim for its &quot;engaging storyline&quot;, with Jumayyil's performance also earning positive feedback.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil Nimal''' (born 19 April 1989) is a Maldivian actor. He has established a career in Maldives Film Industry and is a recipient of several awards, including two [[Gaumee Film Awards]].

Born in [[Malé]], Jumayyil is the son of the renowned Maldivian film actor and director [[Ahmed Nimal]]. After completing his education, Nimal encouraged him to consider a career in the film industry and offered him to play a role in his family drama ''[[Aniyaa]]'', which earned him a [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut]]. Subsequently, he caught the attention of [[Dark Rain Entertainment]], leading to significant roles in their romantic films including ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' (2015) and [[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]] (2016), both of which secured him nominations for the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor]], ultimately winning the award for the latter.

Jumayyil's collaboration with [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] continued with a series of romantic comedies, including ''[[Mee Loaybakee]]'' (2017) and ''[[Vakin Loabin]]'' (2018). He later diversified his repertoire by exploring different genres including the crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019), anthology crime web series ''[[Hatharu Halha]]'' and the comedy film ''[[Maamui]]'' (2019). Following controversies related to his personal life, he had experienced changes in his project lineup, with limited film releases.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil Nimal''' (born 19 April 1989) is a Maldivian actor. He has established a career in Maldives Film Industry and is a recipient of several awards, including two [[Gaumee Film Awards]].

Born in [[Malé]], Jumayyil is the son of the renowned Maldivian film actor and director [[Ahmed Nimal]]. After completing his education, Nimal encouraged him to consider a career in the film industry and offered him to play a role in his family drama ''[[Aniyaa]]'', which earned him a [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut]]. Subsequently, he caught the attention of [[Dark Rain Entertainment]], leading to significant roles in their romantic films including ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' (2015) and [[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]] (2016), both of which secured him nominations for the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor]], ultimately winning the award for the latter.

Jumayyil's collaboration with [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] continued with a series of romantic comedies, including ''[[Mee Loaybakee]]'' (2017) and ''[[Vakin Loabin]]'' (2018). He later diversified his repertoire by exploring different genres including the crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019), anthology crime web series ''[[Hatharu Halha]]'' and the comedy film ''[[Maamui]]'' (2019). Following controversies related to his personal life, he had experienced changes in his project lineup, with limited film releases.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil Nimal''' (born 19 April 1989) is a Maldivian actor. He has established a career in Maldives Film Industry and is a recipient of several awards, including two [[Gaumee Film Awards]].

Born in [[Malé]], Jumayyil is the son of the renowned Maldivian film actor and director [[Ahmed Nimal]]. After completing his education, Nimal encouraged him to consider a career in the film industry and offered him to play a role in his family drama ''[[Aniyaa]]'', which earned him a [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut]]. Subsequently, he caught the attention of [[Dark Rain Entertainment]], leading to significant roles in their romantic films including ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' (2015) and [[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]] (2016), both of which secured him nominations for the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor]], ultimately winning the award for the latter.

Jumayyil's collaboration with [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] continued with a series of romantic comedies, including ''[[Mee Loaybakee]]'' (2017) and ''[[Vakin Loabin]]'' (2018). He later diversified his repertoire by exploring different genres including the crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019), anthology crime web series ''[[Hatharu Halha]]'' and the comedy film ''[[Maamui]]'' (2019). Following controversies related to his personal life, he had experienced changes in his project lineup, with limited film releases.

'''Mohamed Jumayyil Nimal''' (born 19 April 1989) is a Maldivian actor. He has established a career in Maldives Film Industry and is a recipient of several awards, including two [[Gaumee Film Awards]].

Born in [[Malé]], Jumayyil is the son of the renowned Maldivian film actor and director [[Ahmed Nimal]]. After completing his education, Nimal encouraged him to consider a career in the film industry and offered him to play a role in his family drama ''[[Aniyaa]]'', which earned him a [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Male Debut]]. Subsequently, he caught the attention of [[Dark Rain Entertainment]], leading to significant roles in their romantic films including ''[[Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen]]'' (2015) and [[Vaashey Mashaa Ekee]] (2016), both of which secured him nominations for the [[Gaumee Film Award for Best Actor]], ultimately winning the award for the latter.

Jumayyil's collaboration with [[Dark Rain Entertainment]] continued with a series of romantic comedies, including ''[[Mee Loaybakee]]'' (2017) and ''[[Vakin Loabin]]'' (2018). He later diversified his repertoire by exploring different genres including the crime thriller ''[[Goh Raalhu]]'' (2019), anthology crime web series ''[[Hatharu Halha]]'' and the comedy film ''[[Maamui]]'' (2019). Following controversies related to his personal life, he had experienced changes in his project lineup, with limited film releases.
