'''Ismail Jumaih''' is a Maldivian actor, choreographer and makeup artist.

==Career==
In 2016, Jumaih made his film debut in Hussain Munawwar's ''[[Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee]]'' alongside [[Aminath Rishfa]] and [[Ahmed Azmeel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/70075 |title=Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee's First show full, Tickets available at four spots |language=Divehi|publisher=Sun |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606110604/https://sun.mv/70075 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics gave the film bad reviews and considered his performance as Sham, to be &quot;boring&quot; while criticising the character development.&lt;ref name=NeyngiYaaruVakivee&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/14598 |title=The actual reason of &quot;Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606101756/https://avas.mv/14598 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ahmed Jaishan of ''Vaguthu'', found Jumaih's acting to be &quot;natural and impressive&quot; considering his debut role and picked him as the &quot;biggest highlight&quot; from the &quot;disappointing&quot; film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/reports/391659/ |title=Neyngi Yaaru vakivee: Movie Review |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Jaishan, Ahmed |date=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603181732/http://www.vaguthu.mv/reports/391659/ |archivedate=3 June 2016 |access-date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the negative reviews, the film did average business at the end of its run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/entertainment/391632/  |title=Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee premiered to a positive response |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Jaishan, Ahmed |date=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606110957/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/entertainment/391632/ |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jumaih's other release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Hanim, an aggressive member of the friends who get trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and mentioned Jumaih to be the &quot;surprising element&quot; of the film.&lt;ref name=4426review/&gt; Complimenting the improvements he showed from ''Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee'', Nadheem picked his role as the second best performance of the film; &quot;With compliments to Nahula for her character building, Jumaih was deep in the character of Hanim, portraying the role to its fullest&quot;.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest grossing Maldive film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

'''Ismail Jumaih''' is a Maldivian actor, choreographer and makeup artist.

==Career==
In 2016, Jumaih made his film debut in Hussain Munawwar's ''[[Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee]]'' alongside [[Aminath Rishfa]] and [[Ahmed Azmeel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/70075 |title=Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee's First show full, Tickets available at four spots |language=Divehi|publisher=Sun |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606110604/https://sun.mv/70075 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics gave the film bad reviews and considered his performance as Sham, to be &quot;boring&quot; while criticising the character development.&lt;ref name=NeyngiYaaruVakivee&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/14598 |title=The actual reason of &quot;Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606101756/https://avas.mv/14598 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ahmed Jaishan of ''Vaguthu'', found Jumaih's acting to be &quot;natural and impressive&quot; considering his debut role and picked him as the &quot;biggest highlight&quot; from the &quot;disappointing&quot; film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/reports/391659/ |title=Neyngi Yaaru vakivee: Movie Review |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Jaishan, Ahmed |date=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603181732/http://www.vaguthu.mv/reports/391659/ |archivedate=3 June 2016 |access-date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the negative reviews, the film did average business at the end of its run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/entertainment/391632/  |title=Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee premiered to a positive response |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Jaishan, Ahmed |date=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606110957/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/entertainment/391632/ |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jumaih's other release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Hanim, an aggressive member of the friends who get trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and mentioned Jumaih to be the &quot;surprising element&quot; of the film.&lt;ref name=4426review/&gt; Complimenting the improvements he showed from ''Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee'', Nadheem picked his role as the second best performance of the film; &quot;With compliments to Nahula for her character building, Jumaih was deep in the character of Hanim, portraying the role to its fullest&quot;.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest grossing Maldive film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

'''Ismail Jumaih''' is a Maldivian actor, choreographer and makeup artist.

==Career==
In 2016, Jumaih made his film debut in Hussain Munawwar's ''[[Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee]]'' alongside [[Aminath Rishfa]] and [[Ahmed Azmeel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/70075 |title=Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee's First show full, Tickets available at four spots |language=Divehi|publisher=Sun |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606110604/https://sun.mv/70075 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics gave the film bad reviews and considered his performance as Sham, to be &quot;boring&quot; while criticising the character development.&lt;ref name=NeyngiYaaruVakivee&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/14598 |title=The actual reason of &quot;Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606101756/https://avas.mv/14598 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ahmed Jaishan of ''Vaguthu'', found Jumaih's acting to be &quot;natural and impressive&quot; considering his debut role and picked him as the &quot;biggest highlight&quot; from the &quot;disappointing&quot; film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/reports/391659/ |title=Neyngi Yaaru vakivee: Movie Review |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Jaishan, Ahmed |date=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603181732/http://www.vaguthu.mv/reports/391659/ |archivedate=3 June 2016 |access-date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the negative reviews, the film did average business at the end of its run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/entertainment/391632/  |title=Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee premiered to a positive response |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Jaishan, Ahmed |date=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606110957/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/entertainment/391632/ |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jumaih's other release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Hanim, an aggressive member of the friends who get trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and mentioned Jumaih to be the &quot;surprising element&quot; of the film.&lt;ref name=4426review/&gt; Complimenting the improvements he showed from ''Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee'', Nadheem picked his role as the second best performance of the film; &quot;With compliments to Nahula for her character building, Jumaih was deep in the character of Hanim, portraying the role to its fullest&quot;.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest grossing Maldive film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

'''Ismail Jumaih''' is a Maldivian actor, choreographer and makeup artist.

==Career==
In 2016, Jumaih made his film debut in Hussain Munawwar's ''[[Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee]]'' alongside [[Aminath Rishfa]] and [[Ahmed Azmeel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/70075 |title=Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee's First show full, Tickets available at four spots |language=Divehi|publisher=Sun |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606110604/https://sun.mv/70075 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics gave the film bad reviews and considered his performance as Sham, to be &quot;boring&quot; while criticising the character development.&lt;ref name=NeyngiYaaruVakivee&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/14598 |title=The actual reason of &quot;Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606101756/https://avas.mv/14598 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ahmed Jaishan of ''Vaguthu'', found Jumaih's acting to be &quot;natural and impressive&quot; considering his debut role and picked him as the &quot;biggest highlight&quot; from the &quot;disappointing&quot; film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/reports/391659/ |title=Neyngi Yaaru vakivee: Movie Review |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Jaishan, Ahmed |date=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603181732/http://www.vaguthu.mv/reports/391659/ |archivedate=3 June 2016 |access-date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the negative reviews, the film did average business at the end of its run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/entertainment/391632/  |title=Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee premiered to a positive response |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Jaishan, Ahmed |date=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606110957/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/entertainment/391632/ |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jumaih's other release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Hanim, an aggressive member of the friends who get trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and mentioned Jumaih to be the &quot;surprising element&quot; of the film.&lt;ref name=4426review/&gt; Complimenting the improvements he showed from ''Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee'', Nadheem picked his role as the second best performance of the film; &quot;With compliments to Nahula for her character building, Jumaih was deep in the character of Hanim, portraying the role to its fullest&quot;.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest grossing Maldive film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

'''Ismail Jumaih''' is a Maldivian actor, choreographer and makeup artist.

==Career==
In 2016, Jumaih made his film debut in [[Hussain Munawwar]]'s ''[[Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee]]'' alongside [[Aminath Rishfa]] and [[Ahmed Azmeel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/70075 |title=Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee's First show full, Tickets available at four spots |language=Divehi|publisher=Sun |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606110604/https://sun.mv/70075 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics gave the film bad reviews and considered his performance as Sham, to be &quot;boring&quot; while criticising the character development.&lt;ref name=NeyngiYaaruVakivee&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/14598 |title=The actual reason of &quot;Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606101756/https://avas.mv/14598 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ahmed Jaishan of ''Vaguthu'', found Jumaih's acting to be &quot;natural and impressive&quot; considering his debut role and picked him as the &quot;biggest highlight&quot; from the &quot;disappointing&quot; film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/reports/391659/ |title=Neyngi Yaaru vakivee: Movie Review |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Jaishan, Ahmed |date=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603181732/http://www.vaguthu.mv/reports/391659/ |archivedate=3 June 2016 |access-date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the negative reviews, the film did average business at the end of its run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/entertainment/391632/  |title=Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee premiered to a positive response |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Jaishan, Ahmed |date=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606110957/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/entertainment/391632/ |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jumaih's other release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Hanim, an aggressive member of the friends who get trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and mentioned Jumaih to be the &quot;surprising element&quot; of the film.&lt;ref name=4426review/&gt; Complimenting the improvements he showed from ''Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee'', Nadheem picked his role as the second best performance of the film; &quot;With compliments to Nahula for her character building, Jumaih was deep in the character of Hanim, portraying the role to its fullest&quot;.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest grossing Maldive film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!

'''Ismail Jumaih''' is a Maldivian actor, choreographer and makeup artist.

==Career==
In 2016, Jumaih made his film debut in [[Hussain Munawwar]]'s ''[[Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee]]'' alongside [[Aminath Rishfa]] and [[Ahmed Azmeel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sun.mv/70075 |title=Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee's First show full, Tickets available at four spots |language=Divehi|publisher=Sun |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606110604/https://sun.mv/70075 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics gave the film bad reviews and considered his performance as Sham, to be &quot;boring&quot; while criticising the character development.&lt;ref name=NeyngiYaaruVakivee&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/14598 |title=The actual reason of &quot;Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee&quot; |language=Divehi|publisher=Avas |author=Nadheem, Ahmed |date=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606101756/https://avas.mv/14598 |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ahmed Jaishan of ''Vaguthu'', found Jumaih's acting to be &quot;natural and impressive&quot; considering his debut role and picked him as the &quot;biggest highlight&quot; from the &quot;disappointing&quot; film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/reports/391659/ |title=Neyngi Yaaru vakivee: Movie Review |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Jaishan, Ahmed |date=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603181732/http://www.vaguthu.mv/reports/391659/ |archivedate=3 June 2016 |access-date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the negative reviews, the film did average business at the end of its run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/entertainment/391632/  |title=Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee premiered to a positive response |language=Divehi|publisher=Vaguthu |author=Jaishan, Ahmed |date=5 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606110957/http://www.vaguthu.mv/evaguthu/entertainment/391632/ |archivedate=6 June 2016 |access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jumaih's other release of the year came with [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s horror film ''[[4426]]'', where he portrayed the role of Hanim, an aggressive member of the friends who get trapped in a haunted house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/13832 |title=This time its not a &quot;Nahu-styled&quot; film, A revelation |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=26 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052428/https://avas.mv/13832 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of ''Avas'' labelled the film as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and mentioned Jumaih to be the &quot;surprising element&quot; of the film.&lt;ref name=4426review/&gt; Complimenting the improvements he showed from ''Neyngi Yaaru Vakivee'', Nadheem picked his role as the second best performance of the film; &quot;With compliments to Nahula for her character building, Jumaih was deep in the character of Hanim, portraying the role to its fullest&quot;.&lt;ref name=4426review&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/24396 |title=4426 is Nahula's mastepiece |language=Divehi|work=Avas |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=21 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330060956/https://avas.mv/24396 |url-status=live |archivedate=30 March 2018 |access-date=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, ''4426'' was declared as the highest grossing Maldive film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/25919 |title=25 Housefull shows of 4426 screened!
