Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the EPSRC peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences.

'''Early Life'''

Hassan Ugail was born in S. Hithadhoo, Maldives. He received his opportunity to continue is studies in the UK as a result of a presidential scholarship. 
'''
Academic Life'''

Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from King's College London. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 

'''His Work'''
Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. 
The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the PDE (Partial Differential Equation) method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion.

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive CAD modelling and computer animation, design analysis and optimisation for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

Hassan Ugail was born in S. Hithadhoo, Maldives. He received his opportunity to continue is studies in the UK as a result of a presidential scholarship. 

== Academic Life ==


Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from King's College London. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 


== His Work ==

Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. 
The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the PDE (Partial Differential Equation) method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion.

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive CAD modelling and computer animation, design analysis and optimisation for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

Dr. Hassan Ugail, PhD, is a Senior Lecturer at  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bradford#The_School_of_Informatics |the School of Informatics; the University of Bradford]. Dr Ugail's principal 
research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area 
of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the EPSRC 
peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals
and conferences.

== Early Life ==

Hassan Ugail was born in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hithadhoo_%28Seenu_Atoll%29 |Hithadhoo],[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldive_Islands | Maldives]. He received his opportunity to continue is studies in the UK as a result of a presidential scholarship. 

== Academic Life ==


Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from King's College London. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 


== His Work ==

Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. 
The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the PDE (Partial Differential Equation) method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion.

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive CAD modelling and computer animation, design analysis and optimisation for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws. 


== Trivia ==
In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html | &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Dr. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

== His Work ==

Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. 
The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the PDE (Partial Differential Equation) method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion.

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive CAD modelling and computer animation, design analysis and optimisation for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

'''Dr. Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a Senior Lecturer at the School of Informatics; the University of Bradford. Dr Ugail's principal 
research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area 
of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the EPSRC 
peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals
and conferences.

== Early Life ==

Hassan Ugail was born in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hithadhoo_%28Seenu_Atoll%29 |Hithadhoo],[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldive_Islands | Maldives]. He received his opportunity to continue is studies in the UK as a result of a presidential scholarship. 

== Academic Life ==


Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from King's College London. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 


== His Work ==

Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. 
The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the PDE (Partial Differential Equation) method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion.

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive CAD modelling and computer animation, design analysis and optimisation for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws. 


== Trivia ==
In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html | &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Dr. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

'''Dr. Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a Senior Lecturer at the School of Informatics; the University of Bradford. Dr Ugail's principal 
research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area 
of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the EPSRC 
peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals
and conferences.

== Early Life ==

Hassan Ugail was born in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hithadhoo_%28Seenu_Atoll%29 |Hithadhoo],[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldive_Islands | Maldives]. He received his opportunity to continue is studies in the UK as a result of a presidential scholarship. 

== Academic Life ==


Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from King's College London. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 


== His Work ==

Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. 
The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the PDE (Partial Differential Equation) method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion.

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive CAD modelling and computer animation, design analysis and optimisation for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected reference for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

== Trivia ==
In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html | &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Dr. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

'''Dr. Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a Senior Lecturer at the School of Informatics; the University of Bradford. Dr Ugail's principal 
research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area 
of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the EPSRC 
peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals
and conferences.

== Early Life ==

Hassan Ugail was born in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hithadhoo_%28Seenu_Atoll%29 |Hithadhoo],[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldive_Islands | Maldives]. He received his opportunity to continue is studies in the UK as a result of a presidential scholarship. 

== Academic Life ==


Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from King's College London. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Leeds until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 


== His Work ==

Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. 
The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the PDE (Partial Differential Equation) method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion.

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive CAD modelling and computer animation, design analysis and optimisation for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

== Trivia ==
In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html | &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Dr. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

'''Dr. Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Dr Ugail's principal 
research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area 
of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [http://www.epsrc.ac.uk] 
peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals
and conferences in his field of research.

== Early Life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu_Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive_Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu_Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Prepratory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.

== Academic Life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 


== His Work ==
Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE Surfaces | PDE (Partial Differential Equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Dr Ugail also developed the method of [[Biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[Computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

Dr Ugail's resarch work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [http://www.epsrc.ac.uk] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.ASPx?Person=104887&amp;bannerlink=Person%20search]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

== Trivia ==
In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html | &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Dr. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

'''Dr. Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Dr Ugail's principal 
research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area 
of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early Life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu_Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive_Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu_Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Prepratory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship. Ugail currently lives in UK with wife Aminath Muna and kids (Neena Ugail and Noah Ugail).

== Academic Life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 


== His Work ==
Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE Surfaces | PDE (Partial Differential Equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Dr Ugail also developed the method of [[Biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[Computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

Dr Ugail's resarch work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.ASPx?Person=104887&amp;bannerlink=Person%20search]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

== Trivia ==
In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html | &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Dr. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

'''Dr. Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Dr Ugail's principal 
research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area 
of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early Life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Prepratory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship. Ugail currently lives in UK with wife Aminath Muna and kids (Neena Ugail and Noah Ugail).

== Academic Life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 

== His Work ==
Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE Surfaces|PDE (Partial Differential Equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Dr Ugail also developed the method of [[Biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[Computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

Dr Ugail's resarch work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.ASPx?Person=104887&amp;bannerlink=Person%20search]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

== Trivia ==
In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html | &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Dr. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Prepratory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship. Ugail currently lives in UK with wife Aminath Muna and kids (Neena Ugail and Noah Ugail).

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 

== His work ==
Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Dr Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

Dr Ugail's resarch work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

== Trivia ==
In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html | &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Dr. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship. Ugail currently lives in UK with wife Aminath Muna and kids (Neena Ugail and Noah Ugail).

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 

== His work ==
Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Dr Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

Dr Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

== Trivia ==
In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html |&quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Dr. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

'''Dr. Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Dr Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics. Dr Ugail's principal 
research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area 
of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
[[http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/images/staff_pics/hugail.jpg]]Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship. Ugail currently lives in UK with wife Aminath Muna and kids (Neena Ugail and Noah Ugail).

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 

== His work ==
Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Dr Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

Dr Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

== Trivia ==
In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html |&quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Dr. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

On 17th August 2007 Dr Ugail gave a short interview live on &quot;[[BBC World]]&quot; regarding the referendum that decided on the form of government the new constitution of Maldives should adopt where Maldivians voted between a parliamentary or presidential form of government. This historic referendum was held on 18th August 2007. In his interview Dr Ugail expressed his doubts that the election itself would be free and fair.

'''Dr. Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Dr Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics. Dr Ugail's principal 
research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area 
of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship. Ugail currently lives in UK with wife Aminath Muna and kids (Neena Ugail and Noah Ugail).

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 

== His work ==
Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Dr Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

Dr Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

'''Dr. Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Dr Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics. Dr Ugail's principal 
research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area 
of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship. Ugail currently lives in UK with wife Aminath Muna and kids (Neena Ugail and Noah Ugail)

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. 

== His work ==
Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Dr Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

Dr Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

'''Dr. Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Dr Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics. Dr Ugail's principal 
research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area 
of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Dr Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005.

== His work ==
Dr Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Dr Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

Dr Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

== Trivia ==
In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html |&quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Dr. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

On 17 August 2007 Dr Ugail gave a short interview live on &quot;[[BBC World]]&quot; regarding the referendum that decided on the form of government the new constitution of Maldives should adopt where Maldivians voted between a parliamentary or presidential form of government. This historic referendum was held on 18 August 2007. In his interview Dr Ugail expressed his doubts that the election itself would be free and fair.

'''Professor Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Maldivian]] to receive [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  

== His work ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

== Trivia ==
In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

On 17 August 2007 Prof. Ugail gave a short interview live on &quot;[[BBC World]]&quot; regarding the referendum that decided on the form of government the new constitution of Maldives should adopt where Maldivians voted between a parliamentary or presidential form of government. This historic referendum was held on 18 August 2007. In his interview Prof. Ugail expressed his doubts that the election itself would be free and fair.

'''Professor Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford. He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford'']. 

== His work ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. 

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try and observe slight changes in facial expression and blood flow. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological detectors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it. 

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

== Trivia ==

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

On 17 August 2007 Prof. Ugail gave a short interview live on &quot;[[BBC World]]&quot; regarding the referendum that decided on the form of government the new constitution of Maldives should adopt where Maldivians voted between a parliamentary or presidential form of government. This historic referendum was held on 18 August 2007. In his interview Prof. Ugail expressed his doubts that the election itself would be free and fair.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. 

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try and observe slight changes in facial expression and blood flow. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological detectors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it. 

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

'''Professor Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford. He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His work ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

      <text bytes="8086" xml:space="preserve">'''Professor Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford. He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His work ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. 

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expression and blood flow. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological detectors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it. 

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

      <text bytes="8048" xml:space="preserve">'''Professor Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principle research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education from Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987 he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to complete his secondary education at [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and was considered to be bright. In 1992 he received his opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford. He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His work ==
Professor Ugail's principle research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. 

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expression and blood flow. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological detectors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it. 

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

      <text bytes="8081" xml:space="preserve">'''Professor Hassan Ugail, PhD''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principle research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford. He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His work ==
Professor Ugail's principle research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. 

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expression and blood flow. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological detectors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it. 

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

== His work ==
Professor Maahil's principle research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Maahil also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. 

In September 2011, Prof Maahil unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expression and blood flow. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological detectors. Prof Maahil's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it. 

Prof. Maahil's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. 

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. 

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expression and blood flow. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological detectors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it. 

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it. 

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principle research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford .{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His work ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

His methods for the representation of a three dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expression and blood flow.

Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principle research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer based 
physical analysis and design optimisation that fall into the broad area of research known as Simulation Based Design. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford .{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His work ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expression and blood flow. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological detectors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant protifolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail]

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principle research interests are in the areas of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based 
physical analysis that fall into the broad area of research known as Simulation Based Design. Prof. Ugail is a leader in this field and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high level research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]].

He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford .{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His work ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expression and blood flow. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological detectors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail]

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award thus far.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/professor_ugails_column '' Professor Ugail's Column ''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.haveeru.com.mv  '' Haveeru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

      <text bytes="10428" xml:space="preserve">Professor '''Hassan Ugail''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Engineering and Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principle research interests are in the areas of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based
physical analysis that fall into the broad area of research known as Simulation Based Design. Prof. Ugail is a leader in this field and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high level research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford .{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His work ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research is particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. Tangentix has recently launched [http://www.gamesessions.com ''GameSessions''] which enables to try or buy PC games online with ease.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expression and blood flow. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological detectors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]

His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail]

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

Professor '''Hassan Ugail''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist at the School of Engineering and Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principle research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]].

Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford .{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Some of his achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. Tangentix has recently launched [http://www.gamesessions.com ''GameSessions''] which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/professor_ugails_column '' Professor Ugail's Column ''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.haveeru.com.mv  '' Haveeru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Professor '''Hassan Ugail''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist. He is currently working as a Professor of Visual Computing at the School of Engineering and Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principle research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} . Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford .{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Some of his achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research on Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. Tangentix has recently launched [http://www.gamesessions.com ''GameSessions''] which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/professor_ugails_column '' Professor Ugail's Column ''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.haveeru.com.mv  '' Haveeru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Professor '''Hassan Ugail''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist. He is currently working as a Professor of Visual Computing at the School of Engineering and Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principle research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in [http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5 ''geometric design'']. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Some of his achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research in Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. Tangentix has recently launched [http://www.gamesessions.com ''GameSessions''] which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/professor_ugails_column '' Professor Ugail's Column ''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.haveeru.com.mv  '' Haveeru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Professor '''Hassan Ugail''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist. He is currently working as a Professor of Visual Computing at the School of Engineering and Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first and to date the only [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principle research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in [http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5 ''geometric design'']. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Some of his achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research in Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. Tangentix has recently launched [http://www.gamesessions.com ''GameSessions''] which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/professor_ugails_column '' Professor Ugail's Column ''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.haveeru.com.mv  '' Haveeru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Professor '''Hassan Ugail''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist. He is currently working as a Professor of Visual Computing at the School of Engineering and Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first and to date the only [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in [http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5 ''geometric design'']. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Some of his achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research in Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. Tangentix has recently launched [http://www.gamesessions.com ''GameSessions''] which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways.

Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in [http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5 ''geometric design'']. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Some of his achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research in Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. Tangentix has recently launched [http://www.gamesessions.com ''GameSessions''] which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/professor_ugails_column '' Professor Ugail's Column ''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.haveeru.com.mv  '' Haveeru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Professor '''Hassan Ugail''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist. He is currently working as a Professor of Visual Computing at the School of Engineering and Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first and to date the only [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in [http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5 ''geometric design'']. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Some of his achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research in Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. Tangentix has recently launched [http://www.gamesessions.com ''GameSessions''] which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [http://www.haveeru.com.mv/dhivehi/professor_ugails_column '' Professor Ugail's Column ''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.haveeru.com.mv  '' Haveeru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Professor '''Hassan Ugail''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist. He is currently working as a Professor of Visual Computing at the School of Engineering and Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first and to date the only [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in [http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5 ''geometric design'']. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Some of his achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research in Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.

Professor '''Hassan Ugail''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist. He is currently working as a Professor of Visual Computing at the School of Engineering and Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first and to date the only [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in [http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5 ''geometric design'']. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Some of his achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research in Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. Tangentix has recently launched [http://www.gamesessions.com ''GameSessions''] which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed the him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail '' Professor Ugail's Opinion ''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Professor '''Hassan Ugail''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist. He is currently working as a Professor of Visual Computing at the School of Engineering and Informatics; the [[University of Bradford]]. Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics.  He is also the first and to date the only [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.  Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in [http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5 ''geometric design'']. He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the [http://www.visual-computing.brad.ac.uk/ ''Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford''].

== His research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Some of his achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object are all protected under British and US patent laws.

His [http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php ''research in Visual Computing techniques''] has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company [http://www.tangentix.com/ ''Tangentix Ltd''] looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games. Tangentix has recently launched [http://www.gamesessions.com ''GameSessions''] which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800 ''new lie detector''] system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile. This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors. Prof Ugail's system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, [http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php ''the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'']

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail '' Professor Ugail's Opinion ''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com:80/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Professor '''Hassan Ugail''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist. He is currently working as a Professor of Visual Computing at the School of Engineering and Informatics at the [[University of Bradford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail|title=University of Bradford: School of Engineering and Informatics (Staff Contacts)|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics. He is also the first and to date the only [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/feature/53370|url-status=dead|title=Ugail's vision of breeding Maldivian

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

Professor '''Hassan Ugail''' is a mathematician and a computer scientist. He is currently working as a Professor of Visual Computing at the School of Engineering and Informatics at the [[University of Bradford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail|title=University of Bradford: School of Engineering and Informatics (Staff Contacts)|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail is the first [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] to obtain a PhD in Mathematics. He is also the first and to date the only [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/feature/53370|url-status=dead|title=Ugail's vision of breeding Maldivian

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com:80/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com:80/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

He is also the first and to date the only [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/feature/53370|url-status=dead|title=Ugail's vision of breeding Maldivian scientists|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20160303231903/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/feature/53370|archive-date=2016-03-03|website=[[Haveeru]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com:80/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

He is also the first and to date the only [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/feature/53370|url-status=dead|title=Ugail's vision of breeding Maldivian scientists|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20160303231903/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/feature/53370|archive-date=2016-03-03|website=[[Haveeru]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com:80/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com:80/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

He is also the first and to date the only [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/feature/53370|url-status=dead|title=Ugail's vision of breeding Maldivian scientists|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20160303231903/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/feature/53370|archive-date=2016-03-03|website=[[Haveeru]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;im geniuenly confused

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com:80/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com:80/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in  enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

He is also the first and to date the only [[Republic of the Maldives|Maldivian]] to receive a [[professorship]] in the field of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/feature/53370|url-status=dead|title=Ugail's vision of breeding Maldivian scientists|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231903/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/feature/53370|archive-date=2016-03-03|website=[[Haveeru]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging and computer based simulations. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com:80/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and design optimisation that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]].

This research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com:80/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives, that is currently under political turmoil. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive human [[emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive human [[emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com:80/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive human [[emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com:80/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}; for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.     

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.  

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test ‘facial’ lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]] particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu City)|Hithadhoo]], [[Maldive Islands|Maldives]]. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a Lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], [[Spain]]. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a University spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and bio-medical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' looking at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix has recently launched  ''GameSessions'' which will enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work is funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tangentix/|title=Tangentix on Crunchbase|access-date=2020-12-12|publisher=[[CrunchBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in the local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tangentix/|title=Tangentix on Crunchbase|access-date=2020-12-12|publisher=[[CrunchBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in the local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tangentix/|title=Tangentix on Crunchbase|access-date=2020-12-12|publisher=[[CrunchBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in the local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tangentix/|title=Tangentix on Crunchbase|access-date=2020-12-12|publisher=[[CrunchBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in the local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the [https://UgailFoundation.org '' Ugail Foundation ''], primarily through [https://theCircle.mv '' theCircle by Ugail Foundation ''], which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tangentix/|title=Tangentix on Crunchbase|access-date=2020-12-12|publisher=[[CrunchBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in the local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the [https://UgailFoundation.org '' Ugail Foundation ''], primarily through [https://theCircle.mv '' theCircle by Ugail Foundation ''], which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.

Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws.{{When|date=August 2019}}

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.{{cn}}

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in the local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the [https://UgailFoundation.org '' Ugail Foundation ''], primarily through [https://theCircle.mv '' theCircle by Ugail Foundation ''], which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.

The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.{{cn|date=January 2022}}

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date. {{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in the local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the [https://UgailFoundation.org '' Ugail Foundation ''], primarily through [https://theCircle.mv '' theCircle by Ugail Foundation ''], which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12||newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in the local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the [https://UgailFoundation.org '' Ugail Foundation ''], primarily through [https://theCircle.mv '' theCircle by Ugail Foundation ''], which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12||newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. For example, his current research grant portfolio from [[EPSRC]] can be found here [http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887]. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. A list of selected references for his work can be found here [http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/staff-profiles/profile/?u=hugail].

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/articles/qasimforpresident.html &quot;Dream Team&quot;] to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called [https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail ''Professor Ugail's Opinion''] in the local Maldivian language in [http://www.mihaaru.com '' Mihaaru '']  - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the [https://UgailFoundation.org '' Ugail Foundation ''], primarily through [https://theCircle.mv '' theCircle by Ugail Foundation ''], which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12||newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings.

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called &quot;Dream Team&quot; to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings.

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called &quot;Dream Team&quot; to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPSRC Grants on the Web|url=https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=EPSRC}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail - Google Scholar|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=OVa-pz0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called &quot;Dream Team&quot; to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dhivehi Observer|url=https://dhivehiobserver.com/|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Dhivehi Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|access-date=2019-08-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPSRC Grants on the Web|url=https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=EPSRC}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail - Google Scholar|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=OVa-pz0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called &quot;Dream Team&quot; to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dhivehi Observer|url=https://dhivehiobserver.com/|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Dhivehi Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|work=BBC News |date=13 September 2011 |access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPSRC Grants on the Web|url=https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=EPSRC}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail - Google Scholar|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=OVa-pz0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called &quot;Dream Team&quot; to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dhivehi Observer|url=https://dhivehiobserver.com/|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Dhivehi Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14900800|title=New emotion detector can see when we're lying|work=BBC News |date=13 September 2011 |access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPSRC Grants on the Web|url=https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=EPSRC}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail - Google Scholar|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=OVa-pz0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called &quot;Dream Team&quot; to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dhivehi Observer|url=https://dhivehiobserver.com/|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Dhivehi Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPSRC Grants on the Web|url=https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=EPSRC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail - Google Scholar|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=OVa-pz0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called &quot;Dream Team&quot; to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dhivehi Observer|url=https://dhivehiobserver.com/|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Dhivehi Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPSRC Grants on the Web|url=https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=EPSRC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail - Google Scholar|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=OVa-pz0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called &quot;Dream Team&quot; to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dhivehi Observer|url=https://dhivehiobserver.com/|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Dhivehi Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. Prof. Ugail is a leader in the field of [[Visual Computing]] and has greatly contributed to the development of the field by successfully delivering a number of high-profile research and innovation projects, publications and international lectures. He is a member of the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([[EPSRC]]) peer review college and also a peer reviewer for several related journals and conferences in his field of research.

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Prof. Ugail's research work has been funded by a variety of sources. His research finding has been widely published in related international journals and conference proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPSRC Grants on the Web|url=https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=104887|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=EPSRC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail - Google Scholar|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=OVa-pz0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2005, the political Maldivian webzine proposed a so-called &quot;Dream Team&quot; to constituent a future government that would bring forth &quot;democracy and prosperity&quot; in the Maldives. Despite Prof. Ugail's training as a mathematician, the compiler of this list placed him as Ambassador to the UK. Though this may be the case, Prof Ugail continues to remain politically neutral and on several occasions, he has openly said that he has no interest in getting politically involved and that he has no interest in running for the office in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dhivehi Observer|url=https://dhivehiobserver.com/|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Dhivehi Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ugail's principal research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 
In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. Hassan Ugail was a top student and considered to be bright. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Prof. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and is among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford.  He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced numerous novel methods which are being practically utilized in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has many practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail continues to inspire people especially Maldivians in the field of science by giving motivational talks, running local television programmes on science and delivering science related information in enthusiastic and engaging ways. For example, he runs a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work of empowering people by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. Hassan Ugail claims that though his beginning was humble, he was academically much privileged from a young age because his father could speak English and had access to books of varied nature that his father was able to obtain from the British based in Gan Island. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was aquaired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail unveiled a new lie detector system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new system he developed is a complete step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is purely non-invasive and can be used in a covert situation, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail is seen as an inspirational figure especially among Maldivians especially in the field of science. He gives motivational talks, runs local television programmes on science and delivering science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - the most prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes substantial philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills to many thousands of kids and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his academic work as a university professor, Professor Ugail is seen as an inspirational figure especially among Maldivians especially in the field of science. He is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd.

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996 both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|url=hhttps://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|access-date=2023-05-13|website=University of Bradford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.mv|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubradfordstaffprofile&quot; /&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding, in 2013 and 2015 respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives. He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor|title= An in depth interview with professor Ugail|access-date=2023-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title= An in depth interview with professor Ugail|access-date=2023-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ugail.live/en/insights/view/an-in-depth-interview-with-professor-ugail|title= An in depth interview with professor Ugail|access-date=2023-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Achievements ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ugail.live/en/insights/view/an-in-depth-interview-with-professor-ugail|title= An in depth interview with professor Ugail|access-date=2023-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Work ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ugail.live/en/insights/view/an-in-depth-interview-with-professor-ugail|title= An in depth interview with professor Ugail|access-date=2023-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Work ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ugail.live/en/insights/view/an-in-depth-interview-with-professor-ugail|title= An in depth interview with professor Ugail|access-date=2023-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Work ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ugail.live/en/insights/view/an-in-depth-interview-with-professor-ugail|title= An in depth interview with professor Ugail|access-date=2023-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Work ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ugail.live/en/insights/view/an-in-depth-interview-with-professor-ugail|title= An in depth interview with professor Ugail|access-date=2023-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Work ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ugail.live/en/insights/view/an-in-depth-interview-with-professor-ugail|title= An in depth interview with professor Ugail|access-date=2023-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Work ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ugail.live/en/insights/view/an-in-depth-interview-with-professor-ugail|title= An in depth interview with professor Ugail|access-date=2023-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Work ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorishire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ugail.live/en/insights/view/an-in-depth-interview-with-professor-ugail|title= An in depth interview with professor Ugail|access-date=2023-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail's research interests are in the area of [[Visual Computing]], particularly in the area of 3D geometric design, 3D imaging, computer-based simulations and machine learning. 

== Early life ==
Hassan Ugail was born in [[Hithadhoo (Addu)|Hithadhoo]], Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ugail.live/en/insights/view/an-in-depth-interview-with-professor-ugail|title= An in depth interview with professor Ugail|access-date=2023-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his primary education at Nooranee School in [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]]. In the 1960s, Hassan Ugail's father, Ahmed Ugail, worked as a clerk at the British Royal Air Force base in Gan Island in the Maldives. According to Ugail, his father's access to English language resources and books from the British based in Gan Island provided him with academic opportunities from an early age. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Malé, Maldives|Malé]] to continue his education at the [[English Preparatory And Secondary School]] and at the [[Centre for Higher Secondary Education]]. In 1992, he received the opportunity to continue his studies in the UK as a result of a [[British Council]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I became Professor Ugail|url=https://coralglass.media/articles/how-i-became-professor-ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Coralglass Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic life ==
Ugail received a B.Sc. degree with First Class Honours in Mathematics in 1995 and a PGCE in 1996, both from [[King's College London]]. He was awarded his PhD by the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] in the year 2000 for his research in geometric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Ugail|first=Hassan|date=2000|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2052933~S5|title=Design, analysis and optimisation in an interactive environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics at [[University of Leeds]] until September 2002. Ugail joined the School of Informatics, University of Bradford, as a lecturer in September 2002. He was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in April 2005. Ugail became a professor in 2009 at the age of 38 and was among the youngest professors at the University of Bradford at the time. He currently serves as the director of the Centre for Visual Computing at the University of Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/staff/hugail/|title=Professor Hassan Ugail|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[University of Bradford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Professor Ugail's principal research interests are in the areas of geometric design, computer-based physical analysis, and machine learning that all fall into a broad area of research known as Simulation-Based Design and Machine Learning. The focus of his research has been particularly upon a novel method for geometric design known as the [[PDE surface|PDE (partial differential equation)]] method developed at the University of Leeds. The PDE method is based on a suitably chosen PDE that enables to model complex shapes in an easy and predictable fashion. Prof. Ugail also developed the method of [[biharmonic Bézier surface]] for boundary based smooth [[computer representation of surfaces|surface]] design with Professor Monterde from [[University of Valencia]], Spain. His work on computer-based human face analysis based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] has introduced  methods which are being practically utilised in the area of biometrics as well for applications in healthcare.

His research has practical applications, which include building new application environments for complex interactive [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer animation]], design analysis and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] for engineering and biomedical applications such as accurate computer modelling of shapes of biological membranes, the human heart and artificial limbs. Other than that, his research using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] is seen to be applicable to biometric identification such as [[face recognition]], non-invasive [[human emotion analysis]], [[lie detection]] as well as medical image understanding for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/ai-tool-transform-transplant-system-save-hundreds-extra-lives-year|title=AI tool to transform transplant system &amp; save hundreds of extra lives per year|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[National Health Executive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/288390/20230301/new-ai-system-selects-donor-organs-more-accurately-humans.htm|title=New AI System Selects Donor Organs More Accurately Than Humans|access-date=2023-05-13|publisher=[[Tech Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Work ==
His methods for the representation of a three-dimensional object and for the storage and transmission of data representing a three-dimensional object;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422756|title=Storing or transmitting data representing a 3D object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his method for the time-dependent animation of a three-dimensional object &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=GB|number=2422757|title=Time-dependent animation of a 3d object|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all protected under British and US patent laws, between 2008 and 2015.

His research in Visual Computing techniques has led to the establishment of a university spin-out company ''Tangentix Ltd'' that looked at defining and manipulating complex digital data applied to develop computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|title=Data Compression Company Tangentix Raises $2.1 Million|website=Pulse2.0 News|date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014337/http://pulse2.com/2013/03/24/data-compression-company-tangentix-raises-2-1-million-82884/|archive-date=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|title=Professor invents visual computing techniques|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182620/http://www.brad.ac.uk/mediacentre/press-releases/Title_22177_en.php|archive-date=2012-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=Tangentix|url=http://www.tangentix.com/about|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612014713/http://www.tangentix.com/about|archive-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|title=Maldivian scientist recognised for achievements in digital knowledge transfer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030324/http://minivannews.com/society/maldivian-scientist-recognised-for-achievements-in-digital-knowledge-transfer-6371|archive-date=2014-03-22|newspaper=Minivan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tangentix subsequently launched ''GameSessions'' that enable users to try or buy PC games online with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001073645/http://www.tangentix.com/product/gamesessions|archive-date=2015-10-01|title=GameSessions|website=Tangentix|access-date=2019-08-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugail was the founder and CSO of Tangentix Ltd. It was a UK-based startup exploring the use of 3D graphics compression. The company raised both Series A and Series B funding in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and was acquired by Toadman Interactive in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix to play major role in games sector thanks to funding|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/tangentix-play-major-role-games-sector-thanks-funding-1865373|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|date=8 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tangentix secures a further funding round for gaming tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/22/tangentix-secures-a-further-funding-round-for-gaming-tech/|access-date=2020-08-12|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Startups in Sheffield|url=https://tracxn.com/explore/Gaming-Startups-in-Sheffield|access-date=2020-08-12|newspaper=TraCxn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Professor Ugail won the most prestigious award from University of Bradford, the 'Vice-Chancellor's Excellence in Knowledge Transfer Award'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|title=Award for Bradford Professor|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707063635/http://www.asianexpress.co.uk/yorkshire/nov_01_09/bradford_award.php|newspaper=Asian Express Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Prof Ugail showcased a lie detection system that uses two cameras and a computer to try to observe slight changes in facial expressions and facial temperature profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie-detecting camera tracks facial blood flow|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20106077-1/lie-detecting-camera-tracks-facial-blood-flow/|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/09/13/lie.detector.thermal.imaging/|website=[[CNN]]|title=Thermal imaging turns up heat on liars|access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is seen as a step change from the traditional polygraph lie detector, which requires the subject to be wired up to a range of physiological sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport to test 'facial' lie detector|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8de3ee04-dd45-11e0-b4f2-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/HPRgd |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-status=live|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is non-invasive with the potential to be used in covert situations, where the person being monitored potentially knows nothing about it.

In 2011 Professor Ugail received the Maldives National Award for Innovation. He is the first and the only Maldivian to have received this award to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Maldives National Award Winners|url=https://presidency.gov.mv/NationalAwards/Winners?id=7&amp;year=2011|url-access=limited|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Presidency Maldives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugail is also seen as an inspirational figure, especially among Maldivians, and is known for giving motivational talks, and he runs local television programmes on science and delivers science related information. For example, he ran a science column, called ''Professor Ugail's Opinion'' in the local Maldivian language in ''Mihaaru'' - a prominent and widely distributed newspaper in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mihaaru - Professor Ugail|url=https://mihaaru.com/professor_ugail|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Mihaaru News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Professor Ugail undertakes some philanthropic work by delivering STEM knowledge through the ''Ugail Foundation'', primarily through ''theCircle by Ugail Foundation'', which has imparted coding, critical thinking and leadership skills, especially to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugail Foundation|url=https://UgailFoundation.org|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theCircle by Ugail Foundation|url=https://theCircle.ac|access-date=2019-08-12|newspaper=theCircle by Ugail Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
