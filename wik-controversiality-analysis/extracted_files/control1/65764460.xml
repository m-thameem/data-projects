At the age thirteen, Ali decided to marry her best-friend, to which her parents refused citing her young age.&lt;ref name=SuneeGQ/&gt; However, with the help of her neighbors and family members, she managed to convinces her parent for her marriage which lasted three months, when she filed for divorce as her husband disapproved her to play sports with boys of her age.&lt;ref name=SuneeGQ/&gt;
