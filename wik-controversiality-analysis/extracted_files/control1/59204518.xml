Prior to release the film was marketed to be full of &quot;suspense and uniqueness&quot; compared to other mediocre Maldivian horror films. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics; majority of them complaining for having the &quot;same old feeling&quot; of prior horror flicks though the performance were noted to be satisfactory. Despite the mixed reviews, the film witnessed a positive response at the box office, screening a total of twenty two housefull shows in Male', declaring it as a Mega-Hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv:80/?page=details&amp;id=95729&amp;category=ihUfinum |title=Positive comment for the film – Its a big achievement |language=Divehi|work=Haveeru |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=29 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503053202/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/?page=details&amp;id=95729&amp;category=ihUfinum |url-status=dead |archivedate=3 May 2010 |access-date=19 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
