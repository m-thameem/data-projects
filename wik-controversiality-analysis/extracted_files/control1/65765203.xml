In 2008, she appeared in a small role in [[Fathimath Nahula]]'s romantic drama film, ''[[Yoosuf]]'' which depicts the story of a deaf and mute man (played by [[Yoosuf Shafeeu]]) who has been mistreated by a wealthy family, mocking his disability.&lt;ref name=yoosuf&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dho.mv/baiscope/46477 |title=Audience never getting bored of Nahula's style |work=Dho? |language=Divehi |last=Ali |first=Ifraz |date=3 December 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190112154658/https://dho.mv/baiscope/46477 |url-status=live |archivedate=12 January 2019 |accessdate=12 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring an ensemble cast including [[Yoosuf Shafeeu]], [[Niuma Mohamed]], [[Sheela Najeeb]], [[Ahmed Nimal]], [[Fauziyya Hassan]], [[Ravee Farooq]], [[Zeenath Abbas]] and Ahmed Lais Asim, the film received widespread critical acclaim and attained [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] status at box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://avas.mv/7801 |title=Nahula Vs Tedry: Who among the two brought a revelation to Maldivian Cinema? |work=Avas |language=Divehi |last=Nadheem |first=Ahmed |date=6 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908184812/https://avas.mv/7801 |url-status=live |archivedate=8 September 2015 |accessdate=3 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year she featured in the short films, including the erotic thriller ''[[Guest House Room Number:201]]'', comedy films ''No Money Full Beggy'', ''[[Dhanthura]]'' and romantic films [[Umurah Salaam (film)|''Umurah Salaam'']], ''Kushakaanulaa 1'' and ''Maafukuraashey Kalaa''.
