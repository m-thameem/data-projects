She was released on 16 August 2006. She was informed of her release from house arrest through a presidential pardon. Initially, she refused to accept the government offer of release on two grounds: firstly, that her release should have been unconditional and not through a pardon, since this would imply that she had committed a recognizably criminal offence – which she had not; and secondly, she insisted that the other four political prisoners convicted at the same trial should also be released. After consulting with friends and other human rights defenders, Jennifer Latheef agreed to accept the offer of release from house arrest. &lt;ref&gt;amnesty international in asia and the pacific, [http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/apro/aproweb.nsf/pages/goodNews_maldives_ua27305 Good News from Maldives!

She was released on 16 August 2006. She was informed of her release from house arrest through a presidential pardon. Initially, she refused to accept the government offer of release on two grounds: firstly, that her release should have been unconditional and not through a pardon, since this would imply that she had committed a recognizably criminal offence – which she had not; and secondly, she insisted that the other four political prisoners convicted at the same trial should also be released. After consulting with friends and other human rights defenders, Jennifer Latheef agreed to accept the offer of release from house arrest. &lt;ref&gt;amnesty international in asia and the pacific, [http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/apro/aproweb.nsf/pages/goodNews_maldives_ua27305 Good News from Maldives!

Jennifer Latheef's story is worth a read.  It is the greatest hoax of the Maldives' democratic movement.

'''Jennifer Latheef''' is a 32-year-old [[Maldives|Maldivian]] [[journalist]] and [[photographer]] working for the daily [[Minivan News]]. She is the daughter of [[Mohamed Latheef]], a leading [[Maldives|Maldivian]] politician and government critic in [[exile]]. 

According to an [[Amnesty International]] report released in 2003, Jennifer Latheef 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is an artist and video film producer particularly focusing on the prevalence of sexual abuse in the country. She is known for holding views critical of the government and against censorship, and this is believed to be the main reason for her continued detention. She is currently detained under house arrest in Malé. In addition, it is believed that Jennifer Latheef’s continued detention may be a measure by the government to limit the activities of her father, Mohamed Latheef, a Maldivian politician currently living in exile in Sri Lanka where he is engaged in a campaign of peaceful political opposition to the Government of Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA290052003 The Republic of Maldives: Prisoners of conscience should be released], 19 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Jennifer Latheef was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on [[October 18]], [[2005]], convicted of &quot;[[terrorism]]&quot; for joining a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|protest]] in September [[2003]] against deaths in prison and political repression.&lt;ref&gt;Reporters sans frontières, [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=15513 Jennifer Latheef - In prison since 18 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International adopted her as a Prisoner of Conscience during her time in prison and campaigned for her release. &lt;ref&gt;Minivan News, [http://minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=1333 Jennifer Latheef Declared Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience], 18 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

She was detained in Maafushi Prison on the [[Kaafu Atoll]], 18 miles south of the capital, [[Malé]]. She was reportedly not being given regular access to the medication which she needs to take daily to regulate her [[glycemia|blood sugar]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

She was released on 16 August 2006. She was informed of her release from house arrest through a presidential pardon. Initially, she refused to accept the government offer of release on two grounds: firstly, that her release should have been unconditional and not through a pardon, since this would imply that she had committed a recognizably criminal offence – which she had not; and secondly, she insisted that the other four political prisoners convicted at the same trial should also be released. After consulting with friends and other human rights defenders, Jennifer Latheef agreed to accept the offer of release from house arrest. &lt;ref&gt;amnesty international in asia and the pacific, [http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/apro/aproweb.nsf/pages/goodNews_maldives_ua27305 Good News from Maldives!

[[Image:jennifer-latheef.jpg width=150]]According to an [[Amnesty International]] report released in 2003, Jennifer Latheef 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is an artist and video film producer particularly focusing on the prevalence of sexual abuse in the country. She is known for holding views critical of the government and against censorship, and this is believed to be the main reason for her continued detention. She is currently detained under house arrest in Malé. In addition, it is believed that Jennifer Latheef’s continued detention may be a measure by the government to limit the activities of her father, Mohamed Latheef, a Maldivian politician currently living in exile in Sri Lanka where he is engaged in a campaign of peaceful political opposition to the Government of Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA290052003 The Republic of Maldives: Prisoners of conscience should be released], 19 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Jennifer Latheef was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on [[October 18]], [[2005]], convicted of &quot;[[terrorism]]&quot; for joining a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|protest]] in September [[2003]] against deaths in prison and political repression.&lt;ref&gt;Reporters sans frontières, [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=15513 Jennifer Latheef - In prison since 18 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International adopted her as a Prisoner of Conscience during her time in prison and campaigned for her release. &lt;ref&gt;Minivan News, [http://minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=1333 Jennifer Latheef Declared Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience], 18 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

She was detained in Maafushi Prison on the [[Kaafu Atoll]], 18 miles south of the capital, [[Malé]]. She was reportedly not being given regular access to the medication which she needs to take daily to regulate her [[glycemia|blood sugar]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

She was released on 16 August 2006. She was informed of her release from house arrest through a presidential pardon. Initially, she refused to accept the government offer of release on two grounds: firstly, that her release should have been unconditional and not through a pardon, since this would imply that she had committed a recognizably criminal offence – which she had not; and secondly, she insisted that the other four political prisoners convicted at the same trial should also be released. After consulting with friends and other human rights defenders, Jennifer Latheef agreed to accept the offer of release from house arrest. &lt;ref&gt;amnesty international in asia and the pacific, [http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/apro/aproweb.nsf/pages/goodNews_maldives_ua27305 Good News from Maldives!

'''Jennifer Latheef''' is a daughter of [[Mohamed Latheef]], a leading [[Maldives|Maldivian]] politician and government critic. She also worked as a [[Maldives|Maldivian]] [[journalist]] and [[photographer]] for a short period of time. 

According to an [[Amnesty International]] report released in 2003, Jennifer Latheef 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is an artist and video film producer particularly focusing on the prevalence of sexual abuse in the country. She is known for holding views critical of the government and against censorship, and this is believed to be the main reason for her continued detention. She is currently detained under house arrest in Malé. In addition, it is believed that Jennifer Latheef’s continued detention may be a measure by the government to limit the activities of her father, Mohamed Latheef, a Maldivian politician currently living in exile in Sri Lanka where he is engaged in a campaign of peaceful political opposition to the Government of Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA290052003 The Republic of Maldives: Prisoners of conscience should be released], 19 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Jennifer Latheef was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on [[October 18]], [[2005]], convicted of &quot;[[terrorism]]&quot; for joining a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|protest]] in September [[2003]] against deaths in prison and political repression.&lt;ref&gt;Reporters sans frontières, [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=15513 Jennifer Latheef - In prison since 18 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International adopted her as a Prisoner of Conscience during her time in prison and campaigned for her release. &lt;ref&gt;Minivan News, [http://minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=1333 Jennifer Latheef Declared Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience], 18 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jennifer Latheef''' is a daughter of [[Mohamed Latheef]], a leading [[Maldives|Maldivian]] politician and government critic. She also worked as a [[Maldives|Maldivian]] [[journalist]] and [[photographer]] for a short period of time. 

According to an [[Amnesty International]] report released in 2003, Jennifer Latheef 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is an artist and video film producer particularly focusing on the prevalence of sexual abuse in the country. She is known for holding views critical of the government and against censorship, and this is believed to be the main reason for her continued detention. She is currently detained under house arrest in Malé. In addition, it is believed that Jennifer Latheef’s continued detention may be a measure by the government to limit the activities of her father, Mohamed Latheef, a Maldivian politician currently living in exile in Sri Lanka where he is engaged in a campaign of peaceful political opposition to the Government of Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA290052003 The Republic of Maldives: Prisoners of conscience should be released], 19 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Jennifer Latheef was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on [[October 18]], [[2005]], convicted of &quot;[[terrorism]]&quot; for joining a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|protest]] in September 2003 against deaths in prison and political repression.&lt;ref&gt;Reporters sans frontières, [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=15513 Jennifer Latheef - In prison since 18 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International adopted her as a Prisoner of Conscience during her time in prison and campaigned for her release. &lt;ref&gt;Minivan News, [http://minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=1333 Jennifer Latheef Declared Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience], 18 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

She was detained in Maafushi Prison on the [[Kaafu Atoll]], 18 miles south of the capital, [[Malé]]. She was reportedly not being given regular access to the medication which she needs to take daily to regulate her [[glycemia|blood sugar]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

She was released on 16 August 2006. She was informed of her release from house arrest through a presidential pardon. Initially, she refused to accept the government offer of release on two grounds: firstly, that her release should have been unconditional and not through a pardon, since this would imply that she had committed a recognizably criminal offence – which she had not; and secondly, she insisted that the other four political prisoners convicted at the same trial should also be released. After consulting with friends and other [[human rights defender]]s, Jennifer Latheef agreed to accept the offer of release from house arrest. &lt;ref&gt;amnesty international in asia and the pacific, [http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/apro/aproweb.nsf/pages/goodNews_maldives_ua27305 Good News from Maldives!

'''Jennifer Latheef''' (born 1973) is a daughter of [[Mohamed Latheef]], a leading [[Maldives|Maldivian]] politician and government critic. She also worked as a [[Maldives|Maldivian]] [[journalist]] and [[photographer]] for a short period of time. 

According to an [[Amnesty International]] report released in 2003, Jennifer Latheef 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is an artist and video film producer particularly focusing on the prevalence of sexual abuse in the country. She is known for holding views critical of the government and against censorship, and this is believed to be the main reason for her continued detention. She is currently detained under house arrest in Malé. In addition, it is believed that Jennifer Latheef’s continued detention may be a measure by the government to limit the activities of her father, Mohamed Latheef, a Maldivian politician currently living in exile in Sri Lanka where he is engaged in a campaign of peaceful political opposition to the Government of Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA290052003 The Republic of Maldives: Prisoners of conscience should be released], 19 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Jennifer Latheef was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on October 18, 2005, convicted of &quot;[[terrorism]]&quot; for joining a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|protest]] in September 2003 against deaths in prison and political repression.&lt;ref&gt;Reporters sans frontières, [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=15513 Jennifer Latheef - In prison since 18 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International adopted her as a Prisoner of Conscience during her time in prison and campaigned for her release. &lt;ref&gt;Minivan News, [http://minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=1333 Jennifer Latheef Declared Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience], 18 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

She was detained in Maafushi Prison on the [[Kaafu Atoll]], 18 miles south of the capital, [[Malé]]. She was reportedly not being given regular access to the medication which she needs to take daily to regulate her [[glycemia|blood sugar]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

She was released on August 16, 2006. She was informed of her release from house arrest through a presidential pardon. Initially, she refused to accept the government offer of release on two grounds: firstly, that her release should have been unconditional and not through a pardon, since this would imply that she had committed a recognizably criminal offence – which she had not; and secondly, she insisted that the other four political prisoners convicted at the same trial should also be released. After consulting with friends and other [[human rights defender]]s, Jennifer Latheef agreed to accept the offer of release from house arrest. &lt;ref&gt;amnesty international in asia and the pacific, [http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/apro/aproweb.nsf/pages/goodNews_maldives_ua27305 Good News from Maldives!

'''Jennifer Latheef''' (born 1973) is a daughter of [[Mohamed Latheef]], a leading [[Maldives|Maldivian]] politician and government critic. She also worked as a [[Maldives|Maldivian]] [[journalist]] and [[photographer]] for a short period of time. 

According to an [[Amnesty International]] report released in 2003, Jennifer Latheef 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is an artist and video film producer particularly focusing on the prevalence of sexual abuse in the country. She is known for holding views critical of the government and against censorship, and this is believed to be the main reason for her continued detention. She is currently detained under house arrest in Malé. In addition, it is believed that Jennifer Latheef’s continued detention may be a measure by the government to limit the activities of her father, Mohamed Latheef, a Maldivian politician currently living in exile in Sri Lanka where he is engaged in a campaign of peaceful political opposition to the Government of Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA290052003 The Republic of Maldives: Prisoners of conscience should be released], 19 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Jennifer Latheef was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on October 18, 2005, convicted of &quot;[[terrorism]]&quot; for joining a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|protest]] in September 2003 against deaths in prison and political repression.&lt;ref&gt;Reporters sans frontières, [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=15513 Jennifer Latheef - In prison since 18 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International adopted her as a Prisoner of Conscience during her time in prison and campaigned for her release. &lt;ref&gt;Minivan News, [http://minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=1333 Jennifer Latheef Declared Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience], 18 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

She was detained in [[Maafushi Prison]] on the [[Kaafu Atoll]], 18 miles south of the capital, [[Malé]]. She was reportedly not being given regular access to the medication which she needs to take daily to regulate her [[blood sugar]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

'''Jennifer Latheef''' (born 1973) is a daughter of [[Mohamed Latheef]], a leading [[Maldives|Maldivian]] politician and government critic. She also worked as a [[Maldives|Maldivian]] [[journalist]] and [[photographer]] for a short period of time. 

According to an [[Amnesty International]] report released in 2003, Jennifer Latheef 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is an artist and video film producer particularly focusing on the prevalence of sexual abuse in the country. She is known for holding views critical of the government and against censorship, and this is believed to be the main reason for her continued detention. She is currently detained under house arrest in Malé. In addition, it is believed that Jennifer Latheef’s continued detention may be a measure by the government to limit the activities of her father, Mohamed Latheef, a Maldivian politician currently living in exile in Sri Lanka where he is engaged in a campaign of peaceful political opposition to the Government of Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA290052003 The Republic of Maldives: Prisoners of conscience should be released] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115181550/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA290052003 |date=2006-11-15 }}, 19 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Jennifer Latheef was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on October 18, 2005, convicted of &quot;[[terrorism]]&quot; for joining a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|protest]] in September 2003 against deaths in prison and political repression.&lt;ref&gt;Reporters sans frontières, [http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=15513 Jennifer Latheef - In prison since 18 October 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001232805/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=15513 |date=1 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International adopted her as a Prisoner of Conscience during her time in prison and campaigned for her release.&lt;ref&gt;Minivan News, [http://minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=1333 Jennifer Latheef Declared Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022062910/http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=1333 |date=2006-10-22 }}, 18 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

She was detained in [[Maafushi Prison]] on the [[Kaafu Atoll]], 18 miles south of the capital, [[Malé]]. She was reportedly not being given regular access to necessary medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maldives: Further information on medical concern/legal concern/prisoner of conscience: Jennifer Latheef (f) |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA29/008/2005/en/ |website=Amnesty International |access-date=4 November 2021 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was released on August 16, 2006. She was informed of her release from house arrest through a presidential pardon. Initially, she refused to accept the government offer of release on two grounds: firstly, that her release should have been unconditional and not through a pardon, since this would imply that she had committed a recognizably criminal offence – which she had not; and secondly, she insisted that the other four political prisoners convicted at the same trial should also be released. After consulting with friends and other [[human rights defender]]s, Jennifer Latheef agreed to accept the offer of release from house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;amnesty international in asia and the pacific, [http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/apro/aproweb.nsf/pages/goodNews_maldives_ua27305 Good News from Maldives!
