Starring opposite Mohamed, [[Yoosuf Shafeeu]] and [[Ahmed Asim]], the film received majorly positive reviews from critics; Aishath Maaha of ''Dho?'' favored the performance of the lead actors and mentioned the &quot;neat arrangement&quot; of its screenplay though pointed out its &quot;weak ending&quot; to be unsatisfactory while his performance was noted to be a &quot;one-scene impression&quot;.&lt;ref name=Nivairoalhi&gt;{{cite news |url=https://dho.mv/baiscope/48258 |title=Nivaroalhi Review: Its heartbreaking to say Good Bye |language=Divehi |work=Mihaaru |last=Maaha |first=Aishath |date=11 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190207141326/https://dho.mv/baiscope/48258 |url-status=live |archivedate=7 February 2019 |accessdate=7 February 2019 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2024, Azmeel was arrested for a drug related offence.
