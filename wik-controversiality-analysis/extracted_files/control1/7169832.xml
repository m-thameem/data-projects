=== November 3rd 1988 attack ===

General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. As proof to his action stands the fact that he received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense. 

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol.  The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Gen. Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time. 

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Gen. Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned back inside the base through the same gate.

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under seige and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who lead this mission.

After being organized and briefed on the mission by Gen. Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time. 

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Gen. Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned back inside the base through the same gate.

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under seige and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who lead this mission.

Maj. General Jaleel is currently married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim.  He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

=== November 3rd 1988 attack ===

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably. 

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol.  The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time. 

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned back inside the base through the same gate.

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.

== Family ==

=== November 3rd 1988 attack ===

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably. 

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol.  The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time. 

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned back inside the base through the same gate.

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.

=== November 3rd 1988 attack ===

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably. 

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol.  The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time. 

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned back inside the base through the same gate.

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.

His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned back inside the base through the same gate.

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel is currently married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim. He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

===November 3rd 1988 attack===
Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned back inside the base through the same gate.

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel is currently married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim. He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

===November 3rd 1988 attack===
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned back inside the base through the same gate.

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel is currently married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim. He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

===November 3rd 1988 attack===
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned back inside the base through the same gate.

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel is currently married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim. He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

===November 3rd 1988 attack===
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V0G78k6jgg|title= Youtube: Moosa Jaleel 3 November Interview|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V0G78k6jgg|title= Youtube: Moosa Jaleel 3 November Interview|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned back inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V0G78k6jgg|title= Youtube: Moosa Jaleel 3 November Interview|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V0G78k6jgg|title= Youtube: Moosa Jaleel 3 November Interview|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V0G78k6jgg|title= Youtube: Moosa Jaleel 3 November Interview|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned back inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V0G78k6jgg|title= Youtube: Moosa Jaleel 3 November Interview|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 3rd 1988 attack===
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

===November 3rd 1988 attack===
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel is married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim. He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

===November 3rd 1988 attack===
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

Maj. General Jaleel is married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim. He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

===November 3rd 1988 attack===
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel is married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim. He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

===November 3rd 1988 attack===
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==November 3rd 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel is married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim. He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.)

Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel is married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim. He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel is married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim. He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel is married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim. He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission.

Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel is married to Mrs. Jazeela Ibrahim. He has 5 children, with 1 from the current marriage and 4 from previous marriages.

{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack.

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismiss of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismiss of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismiss of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismiss of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismiss of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismiss of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==

{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==

After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ.

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.

==3 November 1988 attack==
{{see also|1988 Maldives Coup}}

Maj. General Jaleel played a pivotal role in organizing and leading the defence of the NSS HQ during the attack. His military training and knowledge proved to be most valuable to the commanders at the NSS HQ. He received a bullet/shrapnel injury to his leg early on while retaliating to the attacker at the North-East corner of the Bandaara Koshi where the fighting was most intense but even with this injury he continued performing throughout the incident remarkably.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

His bravery and dedication are most notable as the Commander of the Recce patrol. The Recce patrol was an effort to venture of the NSS HQ which was under siege to retaliate and gather knowledge of the attacker. The first attempt was made to leave the HQ in buses with a tractor leading the way, this effort was aborted after the gate could not be opened as it was jammed due to damage. The second attempt was made through the Defence Ministry gate (then Police HQ gate) on foot. 11 soldiers with task force training volunteered for this mission. After being organized and briefed on the mission by Maj. Gen Jaleel (then Lt.), the patrol was addressed by Maj. Gen (Ret.) Mohamed Zahir (then Major) who was the leading Commander at the NSS HQ at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The patrol formed up on the half wall fronting the street then with Maj. Gen Jaleel, the commander at the lead of the patrol, ran out through the gate and along Ameeru Ahmed magu towards Huravee Building. Due to reasons unknown only 9 member were able to run out the gate with 2 members remaining inside. As the attackers noticed the patrol running out of the HQ they intensified the fire towards them and additionally a member of the patrol slipped and was unable to use his weapon to return fire which resulted in 3 member of the patrol being killed under fire. The remaining 6 members completed their mission and returned inside the base through the same gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

The mission is undoubtedly the most daring in the modern military history of the country. The soldiers who volunteered for the mission undertook it with full knowledge that they were venturing out a HQ which was under siege and into the hail of bullets from the attackers. And Maj. Gen Jaleel holds a legendary status in the MNDF as the commander who led this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rd November 1988 &quot;/&gt;

==Minister of Defence and National Security==
After the controversial dismissal of the then Defence Minister Colonel (Rtd.) [[Mohamed Nazim]], Moosa Ali Jaleel was appointed as the Minister of Defence and National Security on 20 January 2015. Prior to the appointment of Defence Minister, Moosa Ali Jaleel was serving as the High Commissioner of the Maldives to [[Pakistan]].

==Family==
Maj. General Jaleel has 5 children, from previous marriages.
