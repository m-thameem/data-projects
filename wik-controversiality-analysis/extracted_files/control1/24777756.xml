==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==

During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.

The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.

I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule

1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.


==Political career==

Ilyas Hussein, along with two friends Abdulla Saeed(Kottey) and [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (Anni), began registering a political party in 2001, forty-two people signed and forwarded a proposal to the government to form the Maldives Democratic Party or MDP.

==Manthiri News paper==

Ilyas Hussein registered his own magazine 'Manthiri' many writers exposed and corruption in the Maumoon government. Due pressure from the Government, Maldivian printing presses refused to print Manthiri. People who contributed and helped import the magazine were also arrested.

==FPID(MIFCO)Fraud==

The government fish exporters in 1990 [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] CEO of FPID, someone recorded conversation and the tape spread all over Maldives and among high-ranking officials. When Manthiri published a transcript of the conversation, Ilyas Hussein was arrested and jailed for six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilyashussain.com. ilyas hussain Ibrahim biography]&lt;/ref&gt;


==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==

During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.

The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.

I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.


==Political career==

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.
[[Image:MDP Registration 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison


The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.[[Image:MDP Registration 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==
[[Image:maldives_ilyas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ilyas Hussain Ibrahim in Dhoonidhoo prison]]
During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison


The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.[[Image:MDP Registration 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==
[[Image:maldives_ilyas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ilyas Hussain Ibrahim in Dhoonidhoo prison]]
During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.
[[Image:MDP Registration 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==
[[Image:maldives_ilyas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ilyas Hussain Ibrahim in Dhoonidhoo prison]]
During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.
[[Image:MDP Registration 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison


The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.[[Image:MDP Registration 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.

Ilyas Hussein, along with two friends Abdulla Saeed(Kottey) and [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (Anni), began registering a political party in 2001, forty-two people signed and forwarded a proposal to the government to form the Maldives Democratic Party or MDP.

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==
[[Image:maldives_ilyas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ilyas Hussain Ibrahim in Dhoonidhoo prison]]
During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.
[[Image:MDP Registration 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison


The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.[[Image:MDP Registration 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==
[[Image:maldives_ilyas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ilyas Hussain Ibrahim in Dhoonidhoo prison]]
During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.
[[Image:MDP Registration 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison


The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.[[Image:MDP Registration 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==
[[Image:maldives_ilyas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ilyas Hussain Ibrahim in Dhoonidhoo prison]]
During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison


The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.[[Image:MDP Registration 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==
[[Image:maldives_ilyas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ilyas Hussain Ibrahim in Dhoonidhoo prison]]
During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.
[[Image:MDP Registration 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

Ilyas Hussein registered his own magazine 'Manthiri' many writers exposed and corruption in the Maumoon government. Due pressure from the Government, Maldivian printing presses refused to print Manthiri. People who contributed and helped import the magazine were also arrested.

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==
[[Image:maldives_ilyas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ilyas Hussain Ibrahim in Dhoonidhoo prison]]
During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.
[[Image:MDP Registration 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison


The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.[[Image:MDP Registration 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==
[[Image:maldives_ilyas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ilyas Hussain Ibrahim in Dhoonidhoo prison]]
During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.
[[Image:MDP Registration 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison


The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.[[Image:MDP Registration 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==
[[Image:maldives_ilyas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ilyas Hussain Ibrahim in Dhoonidhoo prison]]
During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.
[[Image:MDP Registration 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.[[Image:MDP Registration 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.

offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.
[[Image:MDP Registration 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.[[Image:MDP Registration 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==

During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in Dhoonidhoo. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6 ft by 3 ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.

I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.[[Image:MDP Registration 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==

During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in [[Dhoonidhoo]]. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

Ilyas Hussein registered his own magazine 'Manthiri' many writers exposed and corruption in the Maumoon government. Due pressure from the Government, Maldivian printing presses refused to print Manthiri. People who contributed and helped import the magazine were also arrested.

When Manthiri published a transcript of the conversation, Ilyas Hussein was arrested and jailed for six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilyashussain.com ilyas hussain Ibrahim biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==

During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in [[Dhoonidhoo]]. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6&amp;nbsp;ft by 3&amp;nbsp;ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.

I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.

Ilyas Hussein registered his own magazine 'Manthiri' many writers exposed and corruption in the Maumoon government. Due pressure from the Government, Maldivian printing presses refused to print Manthiri. People who contributed and helped import the magazine were also arrested.

When Manthiri published a transcript of the conversation, Ilyas Hussein was arrested and jailed for six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilyashussain.com ilyas hussain Ibrahim biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interview with Dhivehi Observer after ‘Black Friday’==

During the rule of this regime, I have been imprisoned five times and kept in solitary confinement in a cell in [[Dhoonidhoo]]. In addition to these imprisonments, I was interrogated and reprimanded by Anbaree Abdul Sattar and Isthafa Ibrahim Manik by summoning me to the Defence Ministry, soon after I returned from overseas after graduation in 1984, over articles I wrote for a students’ magazine. They said the articles discussed Maldivian politics. This matter ended with a threat, instead of imprisonment.

1. First time in Dhoonidhoo prison

This was a matter involved with having heard about the existence of a cassette tape with a recording of a phone conversation between the then state Minister for Defense Ilyas Ibrahim and Maakun Abdul Sattar who was held in Dhoonidhoo prison cell at the time over massive misappropriation charges as the managing director of FPID.

Abdul Sattar received a phone call from the state Minister through a NSS officer while he was in the Dhoonidhoo cell. I was kept in the Dhoonidhoo prison cell for 45 days and then taken to the court and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment. This trial was strange. The person who was responsible for breaking the law remained safe, while those who listened to the recording of the conversation were severely punished.

No question was asked about the nature or content of the conversation between the then state Minister for Defence who phoned a person charged with a criminal
offense, and in custody, to discuss the criminal matter. Many people who listened to the recording of the conversation were imprisoned and then sentenced to further imprisonment, and others were banished. Such is the justice of this regime. During my trial I asked the court whether it is justice to chop all branches and leave the trunk of the tree.

2. Second time in Dhoonidhoo prison

When the government banned Sangu during its infancy, it was the most well-known independent magazine in Maldives. At this time, I registered a political magazine called Manthiri. I registered the magazine according to the laws and rules at the ministry of Information and obtained all required permits. With the layout and the permits, I went around to all main publishing houses in Maldives but in vain. They refused to publish
out of the fear of the regime.

Mohamed Saeed, the owner of Cyprea print, said that although I had all the permits he was afraid of publishing it. After a three-hour political discussion with Ali Hussein of Novelty Printers, his answer was that he could only publish it if I could bring him a letter from the relevant government authorities that there would be no problem after the magazine was printed at his printery.

It turned out that no government department would issue this type of guarantee. So we had to go to neighbouring Sri Lanka to print the magazine. As the printed copies of the magazine arrived at the Hulhule’ airport, the authorities confiscated all the copies. We shipped 1000 copies by air but the Defence Ministry received about 800 copies.
Some copies disappeared in the customs.
[[Image:MDP Registration 1.jpg|thumb|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]
The other editor of Manthiri magazine Adam Rasheed Ahmed of Thalwaaruge (Galolhu ward) and myself were arrested and imprisoned. In prison, Vaavu Lhahutthu and myself were woken up in the middle of the night and interrogated over an article in the magazine I had written under the title: ‘Is the 3 November 88 aggressive attack to disappear into the history as it is now?’

In this article, I discussed how Progress Light ship was gunned and sunk by the Indian navy ship Godhavaree while it was in international waters, and also how small bombs were scattered on the ship from a helicopter. This was carried out after high ranking Maldivian NSS officers were on board the Indian navy ship, and at their orders. I was told about this by a flight engineer of Godhavaree at a meeting with me in the library of the Islamic Centre in Male’. I was told that there was no evidence to prove this story and I was accused of lying and sentenced for 6 months imprisonment.

3. Third time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The third time was in relation to an explosion incident in Male’ in 1990. A group of young people who were involved in a democratic reform movement carried out an explosion in the Sultan park in a way would not cause harm to anyone or damage to property, after being they have been subject to constant harassment from a gang known as Binbi force led by Abbas Ibrahim and Kaashidhoo Hussein Fulhu on behalf of the then state minister for Defence Ilyas Ibrahim.

When this incident took place in late 1990, I was locked in a cell in Dhoonidhoo prison. But the authorities suspected that Anni (Mohamed Nasheed) and I were aware of the incident, so I was kept in detention. During this time in prison, I was kept in a cell 6&amp;nbsp;ft by 3&amp;nbsp;ft, made of corrugated iron sheets sometimes in eh-hulhu cuffs, kees bidi (saw teeth cuffs), chain cuffs, and I was subjected to the punishments of all sorts of shackles.

I was interrogated excessively in relation to some members of the Peoples’ Majlis at the time. I was questioned about Dr Mohamed Waheed and Mohamed (Gogo) Latheef and other leaders. Incessantly, I was told that I was aware that the members of the Majlis discussed holding a vote of no confidence in the president, and I should tell my interrogators about it.

I was kept in this tortured condition for 45 days in the cell, and then taken to the court without allowing me to go home, and sentenced to six years imprisonment. I was sentenced under the terrorism law for not informing the authorities about the explosion in Sultan park.

After keeping me in the small cell in Dhoonidhoo prison for 18 months, I was transferred to Himmafushi prison (north of Male’ in Kaafu atoll). After 18 months in this prison I was released – after three years of jail.

4. Fourth time in Dhoonidhoo prison This time, I was taken to prison in relation to the events that took place on 20 September 2003 after the murder of Evan Naseem (at Maafushi prison south of Male’ in Kaafu atoll).

I was accused of being a leader in the events that followed, and kept in custody for 45 days. When released, I signed a document informing me that they have finished questioning me and there were no further questions to ask me.

This was a conspiracy against me, and a completely fabricated accusation without a shred of evidence. When the incidents took place in Male’ I was in Hulhumale’. There are people who can testify this fact.

5. Fifth time in Dhoonidhoo prison

The fifth time, I was locked up in a cell in Dhoonidhoo in relation to some activities carried out by people at Republic square on 12 and 13 August 2004. This is what is popularly known as the events of Black Friday.

On Friday 13 August, I was taken straight from home to a Dhoonidhoo prison cell. I was transferred from the cell back to home on Tuesday 19 November 2004 in the afternoon and kept under house detention, after being kept in the cell for 89 days. I am still under house detention.
[[Image:MDP Registration 2.jpg|thumb|First political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives]]

On 1 November 2004, a public announcement was made that my case had been sent to the court. I was arrested under article 6 of Public laws No. 4/68 part 2 of schedule 1: ‘Offences that allow arrest, and offences that do not allow arrest’.

On 6 October 2004, I signed three copies of the official forms informed that my investigation was completed. From this moment on, the investigation was officially completed. But I was kept in custody, contrary to the laws and regulations. I have been prevented from attending meetings of the constitutional Majlis, in breach of the laws and regulations. Someone must take responsibility for these matters.

==Political career==

Ilyas Hussein, along with two friends Abdulla Saeed(Kottey) and [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (Anni), began registering a political party in 2001, forty-two people signed and forwarded a proposal to the government to form the Maldives Democratic Party or MDP.

Maldivians are now able to speak openly against the Government.Ilyas Hussain is key founder members [[Gaumee Itthihaad Party]] (the National Unity Party) in September 2009.
