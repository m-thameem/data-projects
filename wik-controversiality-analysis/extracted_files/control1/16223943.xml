With the transformation to a multi -party democracy in the Maldives in 2008, with the aim of aligning the armed forces with a democratic system, Shamaal helped the Ministry of Defence draft the new strategic vision for the armed forces - the Strategic Defence Directive (SDD) in May 2009. The aim of the SDD was to conceptualize the national security related policy and the defence structure of the country. It was the first explicit defence policy document written in the country's history which gave policy, strategic and doctrinal guidance to the defence establishment.

Shamaal also has the honor of being a senior member of the team that represented the presentation of the claim on the Maldives continental shelf at the United Nations HQ in New York, in March 2011. Later, he was also a senior member of the defence team that represented Maldives at the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, where they formally indicated the Maldives’ desire to take part in the UN peacekeeping operations in the future. His office in the Defence Ministry initiated and drafted the project for the soldiers to take part in the peacekeeping operations.

With the assistance from the United States government, and other countries, he has been able to host and coordinate several workshops and forums to educate and train the broader security community, practitioners and the political elite in the country on the need to create integration, participation and synergy within security agencies, and facilitate the democratization and nation-building process.

With the transformation to a multi -party democracy in the Maldives in 2008, with the aim of aligning the armed forces with a democratic system, Shamaal helped the Ministry of Defence draft the new strategic vision for the armed forces - the Strategic Defence Directive (SDD) in May 2009. The aim of the SDD was to conceptualize the national security related policy and the defence structure of the country. It was the first explicit defence policy document written in the country's history which gave policy, strategic and doctrinal guidance to the defence establishment.

His office in the Defence Ministry initiated and drafted the project for the soldiers to take part in the peacekeeping operations.

With the assistance from the United States government, and other countries, he has been able to host and coordinate several workshops and forums to educate and train the broader security community, practitioners and the political elite in the country on the need to create integration, participation and synergy within security agencies, and facilitate the democratization and nation-building process.
