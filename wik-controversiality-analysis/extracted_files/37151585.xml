Prior to his role as an MP, Abdulla Shahid served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1984,eventually becoming Director. In this capacity he also headed the International Organizations and Conferences Department, representing the Maldives at meetings and international gatherings including the United Nations, the Commonwealth, Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of Islamic Conference. 

Abdulla Shahid was one among the chosen people of Dictator Maumoon Abdul Gayoom to help create an image of the Maldives as a democratic nation soon after the 1990 discontent and calls for reform and Democracy. Shahid was transferred to the President's Office for the task and spent a large part of his career as Executive Secretary to the Dictator Gayoom before a short stint as Foreign Minister.  

Abdulla Shahid started serving the Maldivian legislature in 1993 on appointment by Dictator Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, and he became a Member of Parliament in 1995.  In 2000 he was elected as the Representative of the Vaavu Atoll constituency and served two terms as the Atoll’s Member.

&lt;ref name=&quot;foreign.gov.mv&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://foreign.gov.mv/new/tpl/show/content/ashahid | title=His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid,MP  ''A Biographical Note'' | publisher=Foreign Ministry of Maldives | accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shahid holds a bachelor's degree in Social Science (Politics) from the [[University of Canberra|Canberra College of Advanced Education]], and a master's degree in International Relations from [[the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;foreign.gov.mv&quot; /&gt;

With public discontent growing against Dictator Gayoom's controlling system and brutal action to quell political opposition, Gayoom had no choice but to give in, his carefully cultivated image had to be protected and preserved. To address this ëmergency situation&quot; Gayoom set up his trademark Task Force with the highly learned, polished and charming assigned to create a fictitious democracy. Shahid was the perfect candidate for the Democracy Task Force, a Task Force for every calamity being Gayoom's modus operandi. 

As a Member of the JSC, and the Speaker of Parliament Shahid successfully killed the Maldives Constitution in a secret and deceptive move that could not be seen by those unfamiliar with the rules and procedures of Constitutional democracy. Shahid got away preventing an Inquiry using his social status and standing and abusing power of both offices of Speaker and JSC Member to effectively kill opportunity for Democracy through rendering the Constitution meaningless. 

After executing the highly sophisticated and clever Coup Against Constitution (August 2010), Shahid executed a political coup on 7 February 2012 to remove Mohamed Nasheed. He then shifted to MDP and to carry on cover-up and ensure MDP is kept ignorant of his crimes. The devious tactic worked to divert attention away from the core crimes in Maldives Democratic Transition - and to play emotionally with MDP supporters who are unable to see the big picture. 

Shahid will be remembered for his clever &quot;prank&quot;upon the People of Maldives - the [http://www.dhivehisitee.com/parliament/velezinees-insider-account-jsc-hijacked-judicial-independence/ Silent Coup Against Democracy] (August 2010); a highly sophisticated attack on the Maldives Democracy using the Maldives Judicial Service Commission as dagger and the Parliament as shield.
