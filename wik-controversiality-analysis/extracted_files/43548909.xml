Mariya Didi is the incumbent Minister of Defence of the Republic of Maldives, a former Member of Parliament and a leading human rights activist.
She was sworn in as the Minister of Defence on 17th November 2018 by His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. She holds the distinction of being the first female in the history of Maldives to be appointed as the Minister of Defence.

Minister Mariya has a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a Master‚Äôs degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the University of Aberystwyth, Wales, United Kingdom. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray‚Äôs Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol. Mariya believes that her studies laid the foundations that in order for a country to become a nation of laws and enjoy all freedoms that come along with it, democracy and the rule of law have to be introduced, nurtured and allowed to flourish.

Minister Mariya is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. She is one of the few female members of parliament the world over, who has succeeded in sitting in Parliament for four Consecutive terms. As an elected Member of Parliament, Mariya Didi sat in the Constitutional Assembly that amended the 1998 Constitution, which laid foundation for the democracy in the Maldives. She was also a Member of the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution, which was the country's first democratic constitution.

Minister Mariya is the first and the only woman so far to be elected as Chairperson of a major political party in the Maldives. She was elected as Chairperson of the largest political party in the Maldives - the MDP. It was under her chairmanship that the party won the first ever multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. 
In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.

Minister Mariya is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She is blessed with one daughter and two sons.

On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was very badly beaten by some rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President under dubious circumstances.

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She is blessed with one daughter and two sons.

Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the University of Aberystwyth, Wales, United Kingdom. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol. Mariya believes that her studies laid the foundations that in order for a country to become a nation of laws and enjoy all freedoms that come along with it, democracy and the rule of law have to be introduced, nurtured and allowed to flourish.

Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. She is one of the few female members of parliament the world, who has succeeded in sitting in Parliament for 4 Consecutive terms. As an elected Member of Parliament, Mariya Didi sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.

Mariya Didi is the first and the only woman so far to be elected as Chairperson of a major political party in the Maldives. She was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. It was under her chairmanship that the party won the first ever multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008.

On 7 February 2012, the then President of Maldives resigned suddenly in what his supporters called a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was very badly beaten by some rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President under dubious circumstances.

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

'''Mariya Didi''' (born August 18, 1962) is the Minister of Defence of the Republic of [[Maldives]], a former Member of [[People's Majlis]] and a leading human rights activist. She was sworn in as the Minister of Defence on 17 November 2018 by His Excellency President [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]]. She is the first female in the history of Maldives to be appointed Minister of Defence.

Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], Wales, United Kingdom. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol. Mariya believes that her studies laid the foundations that in order for a country to become a nation of laws and enjoy all freedoms that come along with it, democracy and the rule of law have to be introduced, nurtured and allowed to flourish.

Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, Mariya Didi sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.

Mariya Didi is the first and the only woman so far to be elected as Chairperson of a major political party in the Maldives. She was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. It was under her chairmanship that the party won the first ever multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008.

On 7 February 2012, the then President of Maldives resigned suddenly in what his supporters called a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was very badly beaten by some rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President under dubious circumstances.

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

'''Mariya Didi''' (born August 18, 1962) is the Minister of Defence of the Republic of [[Maldives]], a former Member of [[People's Majlis]] and a leading human rights activist. She was sworn in as the Minister of Defence on 17 November 2018 by His Excellency President [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]]. She is the first female in the history of Maldives to be appointed Minister of Defence.

Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], Wales, United Kingdom. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol. Mariya believes that her studies laid the foundations that in order for a country to become a nation of laws and enjoy all freedoms that come along with it, democracy and the rule of law have to be introduced, nurtured and allowed to flourish.

Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, Mariya Didi sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.

She was elected as Chairperson of [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. It was under her chairmanship that the party won the first ever multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008.

On 7 February 2012, the then President [[Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in what his supporters called a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was very badly beaten by some rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President under dubious circumstances.

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.

She was elected as Chairperson of [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. It was under her chairmanship that the party won the first ever multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008.

On 7 February 2012, the then President [[Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in what his supporters called a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Didi was very badly beaten by some rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President under dubious circumstances.

Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

'''Mariya Didi''' (born August 18, 1962) is the Minister of Defence of the Republic of [[Maldives]], a former Member of [[People's Majlis]] and a leading human rights activist. She was sworn in as the Minister of Defence on 17 November 2018 by His Excellency President [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]]. She is the first female in the history of Maldives to be appointed Minister of Defence.

Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], Wales, United Kingdom. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol. Mariya believes that her studies laid the foundations that in order for a country to become a nation of laws and enjoy all freedoms that come along with it, democracy and the rule of law have to be introduced, nurtured and allowed to flourish.

Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, Didi sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.

She was elected as Chairperson of [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. It was under her chairmanship that the party won the first ever multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008.

On 7 February 2012, the then President [[Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Didi was very badly beaten by some rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President under dubious circumstances.

Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

Mariya Didi is the Minister of Defence of the Republic of Maldives. She is the first female Minister of Defence of the Maldives. President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who was sworn in on 17 November 2018, made the bold and historic move of appointing the nation‚Äôs first-ever female Minister of Defence.

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Immigration, Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM), Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP) Office and Maldives Hydrographic Service. 

In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led a very determined and tangible mission to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces, with a view to restoring much-eroded public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces. Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally, reflecting Mariya Didi‚Äôs commitment to building a highly professional and well-trained force. 
Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal, known for his intellectual prowess and scholarly disposition, describes Mariya Didi as ‚Äúpossessing the right combination of well-seasoned politico-civilian experience and education rooted in a strong legal background, wisdom, positivity and charisma, generating an unprecedented level of synergy to guide and steer the MNDF leadership, whilst intelligently striking the correct balance and dynamics of civil-military relations.‚Äù

Mariya Didi is driven by her belief in the importance of information-sharing as a key to ensuring peace and security in a hyper-globalized world. As such, Mariya Didi instituted the tradition of engaging regularly with the MNDF leadership and defence sector agencies through weekly plenary meetings and multi-agency sit-downs, where the latest information and updates are exchanged in cross-sector settings.

For the first time in Maldivian history, Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and sometimes accused of harboring a culture of secrecy. 
In her bid to democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy, for the first time in national history, by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces. Flanked by MNDF Generals at these meetings, Mariya Didi was noted for her commitment to the democratic spirit of public accountability. 
Mariya Didi is an avid believer in the fact that no nation alone can ensure peace, security and stability in an ever-changing climate of globalization.  In this regard, Mariya Didi is known for working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries. 

Mariya Didi is widely known for her role in raising the operational capacity and efficiency of the Maldivian defence sector through several meaningful engagements and historic agreements with international strategic partners. 

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.

A recipient of the US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces. At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. This changed when Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These landmark steps were taken as part of her mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

Breaking further with tradition, Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course. 

It is interesting to note that today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters. 

Mariya Didi‚Äôs Cabinet colleague, Minister of Gender, Family and Social Services Honorable Aishath Mohamed Didi describes Mariya Didi as ‚Äúa pillar of strength for women - standing up for us women and lifting us women up at every step of the way, be it in Cabinet or elsewhere‚Äù.

Mariya Didi is known for her commitment, both vocally and in action, to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism. Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge, including the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism. Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs watch, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.

In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the reins of the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration. In the first 2 years, Mariya Didi oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol, among others. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status. 

Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared up until it was scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.

Hisan Hassan, Chief Executive of National Disaster Management Authority, which was tasked with setting up the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) in Male‚Äô for COVID-19 containment operations, calls Mariya Didi his ‚Äúsource of strength and inspiration especially during the containment operations against COVID-19‚Äù.

A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.

She was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. It was under her chairmanship that the party won the first-ever multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime, marked by human rights abuses and restrictions on civil and political freedoms, was toppled, and Maldivians officially welcomed democracy to their shores.

On 7 February 2012, the then-President Mohamed Nasheed of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was badly beaten by some rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President under dubious circumstances.

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live. The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs regime, deemed more, if not equally, authoritarian in character than that of his half-brother. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. Mariya Didi, an MP then, soldiered on with her mission, unfazed. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the draconian rule of a dictator to a decisive end.

Award-winning local journalist and former member of Maldives Media Council Shifza Mustafa describes Mariya Didi as ‚Äúa strong-willed character.‚Äù

Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the University of Aberystwyth, Wales, United Kingdom. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol. Mariya Didi believes that her studies laid the foundation for her conviction that in order for a country to become a nation of laws and enjoy all freedoms that come along with it, democracy and the rule of law have to be introduced, nurtured and allowed to flourish. Over the years, Mariya Didi has succeeded in translating her conviction to concrete action, through her street and social media activism, proactive involvement and guidance in sowing the seeds of democracy, fostering its institutions and cementing its principles in the collective consciousness of the Maldivian people.
Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.
&quot;As you embark on your professional lives [as Naval Officers], make these solemn words the eternal signposts of your careers. When the horizon seems hazy, there can be no better compass to guide you. When the ground shifts beneath you, there can be no firmer anchor to hold you. And when the swells roil around you, there can be no fairer wind to fill your sails. Duty, Honor, Courage.&quot; - Mariya Didi to graduating cadets at INA Ezhimala, 27 November 2021

Mariya Didi is the Minister of Defence of the Republic of Maldives. She is the first female Minister of Defence of the Maldives. President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who was sworn in on 17 November 2018, made the bold and historic move of appointing the nation‚Äôs first-ever female Minister of Defence.

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Immigration, Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM), Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP) Office and Maldives Hydrographic Service. 

In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led a very determined and tangible mission to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces, with a view to restoring much-eroded public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces. Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally, reflecting Mariya Didi‚Äôs commitment to building a highly professional and well-trained force. 
Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal, known for his intellectual prowess and scholarly disposition, describes Mariya Didi as ‚Äúpossessing the right combination of well-seasoned politico-civilian experience and education rooted in a strong legal background, wisdom, positivity and charisma, generating an unprecedented level of synergy to guide and steer the MNDF leadership, whilst intelligently striking the correct balance and dynamics of civil-military relations.‚Äù

Mariya Didi‚Äôs Cabinet colleague, Minister of Gender, Family and Social Services Honorable Aishath Mohamed Didi describes Mariya Didi as ‚Äúa pillar of strength for women - standing up for us women and lifting us women up at every step of the way, be it in Cabinet or elsewhere‚Äù.

Mariya Didi is known for her commitment, both vocally and in action, to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism. Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge, including the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism. Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs watch, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.

In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the reins of the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration. In the first 2 years, Mariya Didi oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol, among others. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status. 

Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared up until it was scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.

Hisan Hassan, Chief Executive of National Disaster Management Authority, which was tasked with setting up the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) in Male‚Äô for COVID-19 containment operations, calls Mariya Didi his ‚Äúsource of strength and inspiration especially during the containment operations against COVID-19‚Äù.

A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.

She was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. It was under her chairmanship that the party won the first-ever multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime, marked by human rights abuses and restrictions on civil and political freedoms, was toppled, and Maldivians officially welcomed democracy to their shores.

On 7 February 2012, the then-President Mohamed Nasheed of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was badly beaten by some rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President under dubious circumstances.

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live. The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs regime, deemed more, if not equally, authoritarian in character than that of his half-brother. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. Mariya Didi, an MP then, soldiered on with her mission, unfazed. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the draconian rule of a dictator to a decisive end.

Award-winning local journalist and former member of Maldives Media Council Shifza Mustafa describes Mariya Didi as ‚Äúa strong-willed character.‚Äù

Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the University of Aberystwyth, Wales, United Kingdom. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol. Mariya Didi believes that her studies laid the foundation for her conviction that in order for a country to become a nation of laws and enjoy all freedoms that come along with it, democracy and the rule of law have to be introduced, nurtured and allowed to flourish. Over the years, Mariya Didi has succeeded in translating her conviction to concrete action, through her street and social media activism, proactive involvement and guidance in sowing the seeds of democracy, fostering its institutions and cementing its principles in the collective consciousness of the Maldivian people.
Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

&quot;As you embark on your professional lives [as Naval Officers], make these solemn words the eternal signposts of your careers. When the horizon seems hazy, there can be no better compass to guide you. When the ground shifts beneath you, there can be no firmer anchor to hold you. And when the swells roil around you, there can be no fairer wind to fill your sails. Duty, Honor, Courage.&quot; - Mariya Didi to graduating cadets at INA Ezhimala, 27 November 2021

Mariya Didi is the Minister of Defence of the Republic of Maldives. She is the first female Minister of Defence of the Maldives. President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who was sworn in on 17 November 2018, made the bold and historic move of appointing the nation‚Äôs first-ever female Minister of Defence.

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Immigration, Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM), Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP) Office and Maldives Hydrographic Service. 

In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led a very determined and tangible mission to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces, with a view to restoring much-eroded public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces. Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally, reflecting Mariya Didi‚Äôs commitment to building a highly professional and well-trained force. 
Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal, known for his intellectual prowess and scholarly disposition, describes Mariya Didi as ‚Äúpossessing the right combination of well-seasoned politico-civilian experience and education rooted in a strong legal background, wisdom, positivity and charisma, generating an unprecedented level of synergy to guide and steer the MNDF leadership, whilst intelligently striking the correct balance and dynamics of civil-military relations.‚Äù

Mariya Didi is driven by her belief in the importance of information-sharing as a key to ensuring peace and security in a hyper-globalized world. As such, Mariya Didi instituted the tradition of engaging regularly with the MNDF leadership and defence sector agencies through weekly plenary meetings and multi-agency sit-downs, where the latest information and updates are exchanged in cross-sector settings.

For the first time in Maldivian history, Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and sometimes accused of harboring a culture of secrecy. 
In her bid to democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy, for the first time in national history, by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces. Flanked by MNDF Generals at these meetings, Mariya Didi was noted for her commitment to the democratic spirit of public accountability. 
Mariya Didi is an avid believer in the fact that no nation alone can ensure peace, security and stability in an ever-changing climate of globalization.  In this regard, Mariya Didi is known for working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries. 

Mariya Didi is widely known for her role in raising the operational capacity and efficiency of the Maldivian defence sector through several meaningful engagements and historic agreements with international strategic partners. 

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.

A recipient of the US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces. At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. This changed when Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These landmark steps were taken as part of her mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

Breaking further with tradition, Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course. 

It is interesting to note that today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

'''Mariya Didi''' ([[Maldivian language|Maldivian]]:ﬁâﬁßﬁÉﬁ®ﬁîﬁß ﬁãﬁ©ﬁãﬁ©''';''' born August 18, 1962) is a [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] barrister and politician currently serving as the Minister of Defense of the Maldives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=MNDF |url=https://mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/minister-of-defence.php |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=mndf.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being the campaign manager&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Minister Mariya appointed as Pres Solih's campaign spokesperson |url=https://avas.mv/en/126752 |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=avas.mv |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for president [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] during the 2018 elections, she was appointed the nation‚Äôs first-ever female Minister of Defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Immigration, Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM), Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP) Office and Maldives Hydrographic Service{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}.

Mariya Didi is driven by her belief in the importance of information-sharing as a key to ensuring peace and security in a hyper-globalized world. As such, Mariya Didi instituted the tradition of engaging regularly with the MNDF leadership and defence sector agencies through weekly plenary meetings and multi-agency sit-downs, where the latest information and updates are exchanged in cross-sector settings.

== Early life and career ==

=== Education ===
Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales|Wales, United Kingdom]]. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol. 

Mariya Didi believes that her studies laid the foundation for her conviction that in order for a country to become a nation of laws and enjoy all freedoms that come along with it, democracy and the rule of law have to be introduced, nurtured and allowed to flourish. Over the years, Mariya Didi has succeeded in translating her conviction to concrete action, through her street and social media activism, proactive involvement and guidance in sowing the seeds of democracy, fostering its institutions and cementing its principles in the collective consciousness of the Maldivian people. Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

=== Career ===
A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. It was under her chairmanship that the party won the first-ever multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime, marked by human rights abuses and restrictions on civil and political freedoms, was toppled, and Maldivians officially welcomed democracy to their shores.

On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was badly beaten by some rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President under dubious circumstances.

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live. The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. Mariya Didi, an MP then, soldiered on with her mission, unfazed. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the draconian rule of a dictator to a decisive end.

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led a very determined and tangible mission to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces. She did so with a view to restore eroded public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces. 

For the first time in Maldivian history, Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and sometimes accused of harboring a culture of secrecy. In her bid to democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy, for the first time in national history. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces. Flanked by MNDF Generals at these meetings, Mariya Didi was noted for her commitment to the democratic spirit of public accountability. Mariya Didi is an avid believer in the fact that no nation alone can ensure peace, security and stability in an ever-changing climate of globalization. 

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in raising the operational capacity and efficiency of the Maldivian defence sector through several meaningful engagements and historic agreements with international strategic partners. She is known for working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.

&quot;As you embark on your professional lives [as Naval Officers], make these solemn words the eternal signposts of your careers. When the horizon seems hazy, there can be no better compass to guide you. When the ground shifts beneath you, there can be no firmer anchor to hold you. And when the swells roil around you, there can be no fairer wind to fill your sails. Duty, Honor, Courage.&quot; - Mariya Didi to graduating cadets at INA Ezhimala, 27 November 2021

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces. At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. This changed when Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These landmark steps were taken as part of her mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

Breaking tradition, Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

Mariya Didi‚Äôs Cabinet colleague, Minister of Gender, Family and Social Services Honorable Aishath Mohamed Didi describes Mariya Didi as ‚Äúa pillar of strength for women - standing up for us women and lifting us women up at every step of the way, be it in Cabinet or elsewhere‚Äù.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment, both vocally and in action, to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism. Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism. Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs watch, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the reins of the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration. In the first 2 years, Mariya Didi oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally, reflecting Mariya Didi‚Äôs commitment to building a highly professional and well-trained force. Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal, describes Mariya Didi as ‚Äúpossessing the right combination of well-seasoned politico-civilian experience and education rooted in a strong legal background, wisdom, positivity and charisma, generating an unprecedented level of synergy to guide and steer the MNDF leadership, whilst intelligently striking the correct balance and dynamics of civil-military relations.‚Äù

Hisan Hassan, Chief Executive of National Disaster Management Authority, which was tasked with setting up the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) in Male‚Äô for COVID-19 containment operations, calls Mariya Didi his ‚Äúsource of strength and inspiration especially during the containment operations against COVID-19‚Äù.

In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the reins of the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration. In the first 2 years, Mariya Didi oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally, reflecting Mariya Didi‚Äôs commitment to building a highly professional and well-trained force. Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal, describes Mariya Didi as ‚Äúpossessing the right combination of well-seasoned politico-civilian experience and education rooted in a strong legal background, wisdom, positivity and charisma, generating an unprecedented level of synergy to guide and steer the MNDF leadership, whilst intelligently striking the correct balance and dynamics of civil-military relations.‚Äù

Hisan Hassan, Chief Executive of National Disaster Management Authority, which was tasked with setting up the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) in Male‚Äô for COVID-19 containment operations, calls Mariya Didi his ‚Äúsource of strength and inspiration especially during the containment operations against COVID-19‚Äù.

'''Mariya Didi''' ([[Maldivian language|Maldivian]]:ﬁâﬁßﬁÉﬁ®ﬁîﬁß ﬁãﬁ©ﬁãﬁ©''';''' born August 18, 1962) is a [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] barrister and politician currently serving as the Minister of Defense of the Maldives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=MNDF |url=https://mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/minister-of-defence.php |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=mndf.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being the campaign manager&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Minister Mariya appointed as Pres Solih's campaign spokesperson |url=https://avas.mv/en/126752 |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=avas.mv |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for president [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] during the 2018 elections, she was appointed the nation‚Äôs first-ever female Minister of Defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Immigration, Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM), Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP) Office and Maldives Hydrographic Service{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}.

Mariya Didi instituted the tradition of engaging regularly with the MNDF leadership and defence sector agencies through weekly plenary meetings and multi-agency sit-downs, where the latest information and updates are exchanged in cross-sector settings.

== Early life and career ==

=== Education ===
Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales|Wales, United Kingdom]]. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol.

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

=== Career ===
A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-03-08 |title=Maldivian wins ‚ÄòInternational Woman of Courage‚Äô award |url=https://themdp.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/maldivian-wins-%e2%80%98international-woman-of-courage%e2%80%99-award/ |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=Maldivian Democratic Party |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. It was under her chairmanship that the party won the first-ever multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime, marked by human rights abuses and restrictions on civil and political freedoms, was toppled, and Maldivians officially welcomed democracy to their shores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy

On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was badly beaten by some rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President under dubious circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Police revolt |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the draconian rule of a dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led a very determined and tangible mission to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces. She did so with a view to restore eroded public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in Maldivian history, Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and sometimes accused of harboring a culture of secrecy. In her bid to democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy, for the first time in national history. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flanked by MNDF Generals at these meetings, Mariya Didi was noted for her commitment to the democratic spirit of public accountability.

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in raising the operational capacity and efficiency of the Maldivian defence sector through several meaningful engagements and historic agreements with international strategic partners. She is known for working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=March 26, 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. This changed when Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These landmark steps were taken as part of her mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2022 |title=Female officers making unprecedented progress: Defence Minister |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/101625 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=psmnews.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breaking tradition, Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment, both vocally and in action, to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs watch, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the reins of the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal= |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, Mariya Didi oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally, reflecting Mariya Didi‚Äôs commitment to building a highly professional and well-trained force. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=July 6, 2020 |title=MNDF's role in Covid-19 response efforts, has been monumental: president |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/82025 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 she was awarded the [[International Women of Courage Award]] by the [[US Secretary of State]] for her work promoting [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Lansford |editor-first=Tom |year=2015 |title=Political Handbook of the World 2015 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=9781483371559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mariya Didi''' ([[Maldivian language|Maldivian]]:ﬁâﬁßﬁÉﬁ®ﬁîﬁß ﬁãﬁ©ﬁãﬁ©''';''' born August 18, 1962) is a [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] barrister and politician currently serving as the Minister of Defense of the Maldives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=MNDF |url=https://mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/minister-of-defence.php |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=mndf.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being the campaign manager&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Minister Mariya appointed as Pres Solih's campaign spokesperson |url=https://avas.mv/en/126752 |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=avas.mv |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for president [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] during the 2018 elections, she was appointed the nation‚Äôs first-ever female Minister of Defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Immigration, Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM), Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP) Office and Maldives Hydrographic Service{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}.

Mariya Didi instituted the tradition of engaging regularly with the MNDF leadership and defence sector agencies through weekly plenary meetings and multi-agency sit-downs, where the latest information and updates are exchanged in cross-sector settings.

== Early life and career ==

=== Education ===
Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales|Wales, United Kingdom]]. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol.

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

=== Career ===
A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-03-08 |title=Maldivian wins ‚ÄòInternational Woman of Courage‚Äô award |url=https://themdp.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/maldivian-wins-%e2%80%98international-woman-of-courage%e2%80%99-award/ |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=Maldivian Democratic Party |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. It was under her chairmanship that the party won the first-ever multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime, marked by human rights abuses and restrictions on civil and political freedoms, was toppled, and Maldivians officially welcomed democracy to their shores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy

On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was  beaten by  rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President under dubious circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Police revolt |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the draconian rule of a dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led a very determined and tangible mission to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces. She did so with a view to restore eroded public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in Maldivian history, Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and sometimes accused of harboring a culture of secrecy. In her bid to democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in raising the operational capacity and efficiency of the Maldivian defence sector through several meaningful engagements and historic agreements with international strategic partners. She is known for working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Immigration, Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM), Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP) Office and Maldives Hydrographic Service{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}.

Mariya Didi instituted the tradition of engaging regularly with the MNDF leadership and defence sector agencies through weekly plenary meetings and multi-agency sit-downs, where the latest information and updates are exchanged in cross-sector settings.

== Early life and career ==

=== Education ===
Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales|Wales, United Kingdom]]. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol.

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

=== Career ===
A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-03-08 |title=Maldivian wins ‚ÄòInternational Woman of Courage‚Äô award |url=https://themdp.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/maldivian-wins-%e2%80%98international-woman-of-courage%e2%80%99-award/ |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=Maldivian Democratic Party |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. It was under her chairmanship that the party won the first-ever multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime, marked by human rights abuses and restrictions on civil and political freedoms, was toppled, and Maldivians officially welcomed democracy to their shores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy

On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was  beaten by  rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President under dubious circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Police revolt |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the draconian rule of a dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led a very determined and tangible mission to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces. She did so with a view to restore eroded public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in Maldivian history, Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and sometimes accused of harboring a culture of secrecy. In her bid to democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in raising the operational capacity and efficiency of the Maldivian defence sector through several meaningful engagements and historic agreements with international strategic partners. She is known for working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=March 26, 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. This changed when Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These landmark steps were taken as part of her mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2022 |title=Female officers making unprecedented progress: Defence Minister |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/101625 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=psmnews.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breaking tradition, Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment, both vocally and in action, to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs watch, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the reins of the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal= |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, Mariya Didi oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=July 6, 2020 |title=MNDF's role in Covid-19 response efforts, has been monumental: president |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/82025 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 she was awarded the [[International Women of Courage Award]] by the [[US Secretary of State]] for her work promoting [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Lansford |editor-first=Tom |year=2015 |title=Political Handbook of the World 2015 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=9781483371559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs leadership, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal= |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, she oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=July 6, 2020 |title=MNDF's role in Covid-19 response efforts, has been monumental: president |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/82025 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mariya Didi''' ([[Maldivian language|Maldivian]]:ﬁâﬁßﬁÉﬁ®ﬁîﬁß ﬁãﬁ©ﬁãﬁ©''';''' born August 18, 1962) is a [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] barrister and politician currently serving as the Minister of Defense of the Maldives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=MNDF |url=https://mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/minister-of-defence.php |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=mndf.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being the campaign manager&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Minister Mariya appointed as Pres Solih's campaign spokesperson |url=https://avas.mv/en/126752 |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=avas.mv |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for president [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] during the 2018 elections, she was appointed the nation‚Äôs first-ever female Minister of Defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Immigration, Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM), Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP) Office and Maldives Hydrographic Service{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}.

Mariya Didi instituted the tradition of engaging regularly with the MNDF leadership and defence sector agencies through weekly plenary meetings and multi-agency sit-downs, where the latest information and updates are exchanged in cross-sector settings.

== Early life and career ==

=== Education ===
Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales|Wales, United Kingdom]]. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol.

In 2007 she was awarded the [[International Women of Courage Award]] by the [[US Secretary of State]] for her work promoting [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Handbook of the World 2015 |publisher=SAGE Publications |year=2015 |isbn=9781483371559 |editor-last=Lansford |editor-first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

=== Career ===
A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-03-08 |title=Maldivian wins ‚ÄòInternational Woman of Courage‚Äô award |url=https://themdp.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/maldivian-wins-%e2%80%98international-woman-of-courage%e2%80%99-award/ |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=Maldivian Democratic Party |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. Under her chairmanship, the party won their first multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The electoral win marked an end to the preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime and established democracy in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy

=== Role in democracy ===
On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was beaten by rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Police revolt |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the rule of the dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led an initiative to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces to restore  public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and a culture of secrecy. To democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=March 26, 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These steps were taken as part of a mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2022 |title=Female officers making unprecedented progress: Defence Minister |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/101625 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=psmnews.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs leadership, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal= |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, she oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=July 6, 2020 |title=MNDF's role in Covid-19 response efforts, has been monumental: president |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/82025 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-03-08 |title=Maldivian wins ‚ÄòInternational Woman of Courage‚Äô award |url=https://themdp.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/maldivian-wins-%e2%80%98international-woman-of-courage%e2%80%99-award/ |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=Maldivian Democratic Party |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. Under her chairmanship, the party won their first multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The electoral win marked an end to the preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime and established democracy in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy and the Quest for Consolidation |url=https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/67543305/The_Maldives_From_Dictatorship_to_Constitutional_Democracy_and_the_Quest_for_Consolidation.pdf |journal=The University of Portsmouth Research Portal |via=The University of Portsmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role in democracy ===
On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was beaten by rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Police revolt |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the rule of the dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led an initiative to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces to restore  public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and a culture of secrecy. To democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=March 26, 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These steps were taken as part of a mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2022 |title=Female officers making unprecedented progress: Defence Minister |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/101625 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=psmnews.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs leadership, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal= |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, she oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=July 6, 2020 |title=MNDF's role in Covid-19 response efforts, has been monumental: president |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/82025 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime.

'''Mariya Didi''' ([[Maldivian language|Maldivian]]:ﬁâﬁßﬁÉﬁ®ﬁîﬁß ﬁãﬁ©ﬁãﬁ©''';''' born August 18, 1962) is a [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] barrister and politician currently serving as the Minister of Defense of the Maldives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=MNDF |url=https://mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/minister-of-defence.php |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=mndf.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being the campaign manager&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Minister Mariya appointed as Pres Solih's campaign spokesperson |url=https://avas.mv/en/126752 |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=avas.mv |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for president [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] during the 2018 elections, she was appointed the nation‚Äôs first-ever female Minister of Defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Immigration, Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM), Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP) Office and Maldives Hydrographic Service{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}.

Mariya Didi instituted the tradition of engaging regularly with the MNDF leadership and defence sector agencies through weekly plenary meetings and multi-agency sit-downs, where the latest information and updates are exchanged in cross-sector settings.

== Early life and career ==

=== Education ===
Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales|Wales, United Kingdom]]. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol.

In 2007 she was awarded the [[International Women of Courage Award]] by the [[US Secretary of State]] for her work promoting [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Handbook of the World 2015 |publisher=SAGE Publications |year=2015 |isbn=9781483371559 |editor-last=Lansford |editor-first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

=== Career ===
A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-03-08 |title=Maldivian wins ‚ÄòInternational Woman of Courage‚Äô award |url=https://themdp.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/maldivian-wins-%e2%80%98international-woman-of-courage%e2%80%99-award/ |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=Maldivian Democratic Party |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. Under her chairmanship, the party won their first multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The electoral win marked an end to the preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime and established democracy in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy and the Quest for Consolidation |url=https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/67543305/The_Maldives_From_Dictatorship_to_Constitutional_Democracy_and_the_Quest_for_Consolidation.pdf |journal=The University of Portsmouth Research Portal |via=The University of Portsmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role in democracy ===
On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was beaten by rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Police revolt |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the rule of the dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led an initiative to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces to restore  public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and a culture of secrecy. To democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=March 26, 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These steps were taken as part of a mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2022 |title=Female officers making unprecedented progress: Defence Minister |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/101625 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=psmnews.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs leadership, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal= |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, she oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=July 6, 2020 |title=MNDF's role in Covid-19 response efforts, has been monumental: president |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/82025 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=March 26, 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These steps were taken as part of a mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2022 |title=Female officers making unprecedented progress: Defence Minister |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/101625 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=psmnews.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs leadership, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal= |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, she oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=July 6, 2020 |title=MNDF's role in Covid-19 response efforts, has been monumental: president |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/82025 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mariya Didi''' ([[Maldivian language|Maldivian]]:ﬁâﬁßﬁÉﬁ®ﬁîﬁß ﬁãﬁ©ﬁãﬁ©''';''' born August 18, 1962) is a [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] barrister and politician currently serving as the Minister of Defense of the Maldives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=MNDF |url=https://mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/minister-of-defence.php |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=mndf.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being the campaign manager&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Minister Mariya appointed as Pres Solih's campaign spokesperson |url=https://avas.mv/en/126752 |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=avas.mv |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for president [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] during the 2018 elections, she was appointed the nation‚Äôs first-ever female Minister of Defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Immigration, Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM), Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP) Office and Maldives Hydrographic Service{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}.

Mariya Didi instituted the tradition of engaging regularly with the MNDF leadership and defence sector agencies through weekly plenary meetings and multi-agency sit-downs, where the latest information and updates are exchanged in cross-sector settings.

== Early life and career ==

=== Education ===
Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales|Wales, United Kingdom]]. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol.

In 2007 she was awarded the [[International Women of Courage Award]] by the [[US Secretary of State]] for her work promoting [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Handbook of the World 2015 |publisher=SAGE Publications |year=2015 |isbn=9781483371559 |editor-last=Lansford |editor-first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

=== Career ===
A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-03-08 |title=Maldivian wins ‚ÄòInternational Woman of Courage‚Äô award |url=https://themdp.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/maldivian-wins-%e2%80%98international-woman-of-courage%e2%80%99-award/ |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=Maldivian Democratic Party |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. Under her chairmanship, the party won their first multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The electoral win marked an end to the preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime and established democracy in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy and the Quest for Consolidation |url=https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/67543305/The_Maldives_From_Dictatorship_to_Constitutional_Democracy_and_the_Quest_for_Consolidation.pdf |journal=The University of Portsmouth Research Portal |via=The University of Portsmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role in democracy ===
On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was beaten by rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Police revolt |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the rule of the dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led an initiative to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces to restore  public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and a culture of secrecy. To democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=March 26, 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership.

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol.

In 2007 she was awarded the [[International Women of Courage Award]] by the [[US Secretary of State]] for her work promoting [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Handbook of the World 2015 |publisher=SAGE Publications |year=2015 |isbn=9781483371559 |editor-last=Lansford |editor-first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

=== Career ===
A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-03-08 |title=Maldivian wins ‚ÄòInternational Woman of Courage‚Äô award |url=https://themdp.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/maldivian-wins-%e2%80%98international-woman-of-courage%e2%80%99-award/ |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=Maldivian Democratic Party |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. Under her chairmanship, the party won their first multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The electoral win marked an end to the preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime and established democracy in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy and the Quest for Consolidation |url=https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/67543305/The_Maldives_From_Dictatorship_to_Constitutional_Democracy_and_the_Quest_for_Consolidation.pdf |journal=The University of Portsmouth Research Portal |via=The University of Portsmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role in democracy ===
On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was beaten by rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Police revolt |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the rule of the dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led an initiative to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces to restore  public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and a culture of secrecy. To democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=March 26, 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These steps were taken as part of a mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2022 |title=Female officers making unprecedented progress: Defence Minister |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/101625 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=psmnews.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs leadership, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal= |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, she oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=July 6, 2020 |title=MNDF's role in Covid-19 response efforts, has been monumental: president |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/82025 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime.

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs leadership, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal= |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, she oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=July 6, 2020 |title=MNDF's role in Covid-19 response efforts, has been monumental: president |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/82025 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mariya Didi''' ([[Maldivian language|Maldivian]]:ﬁâﬁßﬁÉﬁ®ﬁîﬁß ﬁãﬁ©ﬁãﬁ©''';''' born August 18, 1962) is a [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] barrister and politician who served as the Minister of Defense of the Maldives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=MNDF |url=https://mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/minister-of-defence.php |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=mndf.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being the campaign manager&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Minister Mariya appointed as Pres Solih's campaign spokesperson |url=https://avas.mv/en/126752 |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=avas.mv |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for president [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] during the 2018 elections, she was appointed the nation‚Äôs first-ever female Minister of Defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Immigration, Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM), Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP) Office and Maldives Hydrographic Service{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}.

Mariya Didi instituted the tradition of engaging regularly with the MNDF leadership and defence sector agencies through weekly plenary meetings and multi-agency sit-downs, where the latest information and updates are exchanged in cross-sector settings.

== Early life and career ==

=== Education ===
Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales|Wales, United Kingdom]]. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol.

In 2007 she was awarded the [[International Women of Courage Award]] by the [[US Secretary of State]] for her work promoting [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Handbook of the World 2015 |publisher=SAGE Publications |year=2015 |isbn=9781483371559 |editor-last=Lansford |editor-first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

=== Career ===
A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-03-08 |title=Maldivian wins ‚ÄòInternational Woman of Courage‚Äô award |url=https://themdp.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/maldivian-wins-%e2%80%98international-woman-of-courage%e2%80%99-award/ |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=Maldivian Democratic Party |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. Under her chairmanship, the party won their first multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The electoral win marked an end to the preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime and established democracy in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy and the Quest for Consolidation |url=https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/67543305/The_Maldives_From_Dictatorship_to_Constitutional_Democracy_and_the_Quest_for_Consolidation.pdf |journal=The University of Portsmouth Research Portal |via=The University of Portsmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role in democracy ===
On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was beaten by rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Police revolt |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the rule of the dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led an initiative to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces to restore  public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and a culture of secrecy. To democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=March 26, 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These steps were taken as part of a mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2022 |title=Female officers making unprecedented progress: Defence Minister |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/101625 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=psmnews.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-03-08 |title=Maldivian wins ‚ÄòInternational Woman of Courage‚Äô award |url=https://themdp.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/maldivian-wins-%e2%80%98international-woman-of-courage%e2%80%99-award/ |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=Maldivian Democratic Party |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. Under her chairmanship, the party won their first multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The electoral win marked an end to the preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime and established democracy in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy and the Quest for Consolidation |url=https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/67543305/The_Maldives_From_Dictatorship_to_Constitutional_Democracy_and_the_Quest_for_Consolidation.pdf |journal=The University of Portsmouth Research Portal |via=The University of Portsmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role in democracy ===
On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was beaten by rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Police revolt |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the rule of the dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led an initiative to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces to restore  public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and a culture of secrecy. To democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=March 26, 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These steps were taken as part of a mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2022 |title=Female officers making unprecedented progress: Defence Minister |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/101625 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=psmnews.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs leadership, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal= |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, she oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=July 6, 2020 |title=MNDF's role in Covid-19 response efforts, has been monumental: president |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/82025 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal= |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, she oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=July 6, 2020 |title=MNDF's role in Covid-19 response efforts, has been monumental: president |work=Raajje MV |url=https://raajje.mv/82025 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mariya Didi''' ([[Maldivian language|Maldivian]]:ﬁâﬁßﬁÉﬁ®ﬁîﬁß ﬁãﬁ©ﬁãﬁ©''';''' born August 18, 1962) is a [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] barrister and politician who served as the Minister of Defense of the Maldives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=MNDF |url=https://mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/minister-of-defence.php |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=mndf.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being the campaign manager&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Minister Mariya appointed as Pres Solih's campaign spokesperson |url=https://avas.mv/en/126752 |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=avas.mv |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for president [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] during the 2018 elections, she was appointed the nation‚Äôs first-ever female Minister of Defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Immigration, Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM), Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP) Office and Maldives Hydrographic Service{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}.

Mariya Didi instituted the tradition of engaging regularly with the MNDF leadership and defence sector agencies through weekly plenary meetings and multi-agency sit-downs, where the latest information and updates are exchanged in cross-sector settings.

== Early life and career ==

=== Education ===
Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in Law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales|Wales, United Kingdom]]. She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol.

In 2007, she was awarded the [[International Women of Courage Award]] by the [[US Secretary of State]] for her work promoting [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Handbook of the World 2015 |publisher=SAGE Publications |year=2015 |isbn=9781483371559 |editor-last=Lansford |editor-first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.

=== Career ===
A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the 2008 Constitution. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-03-08 |title=Maldivian wins ‚ÄòInternational Woman of Courage‚Äô award |url=https://themdp.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/maldivian-wins-%e2%80%98international-woman-of-courage%e2%80%99-award/ |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=Maldivian Democratic Party |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. Under her chairmanship, the party won their first multiparty democratic presidential elections held in the Maldives in 2008. The electoral win marked an end to the preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime and established democracy in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy and the Quest for Consolidation |url=https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/67543305/The_Maldives_From_Dictatorship_to_Constitutional_Democracy_and_the_Quest_for_Consolidation.pdf |journal=The University of Portsmouth Research Portal |via=The University of Portsmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role in democracy ===
On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was beaten by rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Police revolt |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 4, 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the rule of the dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led an initiative to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces to restore  public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and a culture of secrecy. To democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=March 26, 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Raajje.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These steps were taken as part of a mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2022 |title=Female officers making unprecedented progress: Defence Minister |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/101625 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=psmnews.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs leadership, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====

On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was beaten by rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=7 February 2012 |title=Maldives president quits after protests |work=Al Jazeera |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih‚Äôs campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shaany |first=Aishath |date=4 July 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |work=raajje.mv |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation‚Äôs democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the rule of the dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led an initiative to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces to restore  public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF‚Äôs grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |work=PSM News |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and a culture of secrecy. To democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF‚Äôs alleged tradition of secrecy. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament‚Äôs National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation‚Äôs defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |work=Maldives News Network |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states India and Sri Lanka, to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the Passing Out Parade (POP) - Autumn Term at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) in Ezhimala - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department‚Äôs International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=26 March 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |work=raajje.mv |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the Council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the Council for the first time. These steps were taken as part of a mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF‚Äôs decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=21 April 2022 |title=Female officers making unprecedented progress: Defence Minister |work=PSM News |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/101625 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment to the Solih administration‚Äôs efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi‚Äôs leadership, the National Counter Terrorism Center played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the Center‚Äôs national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal=Trafficking in Persons |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, she oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's COVID-19 containment effort in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=raajje.mv |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite constraints posed by COVID-19, at least 60 percent of MNDF soldiers were trained, both locally and internationally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=July 6, 2020 |title=MNDF's role in Covid-19 response efforts, has been monumental: president |work=raajje.mv |url=https://raajje.mv/82025 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. Under her chairmanship, the party won their first multiparty democratic [[2008 Maldivian presidential election|presidential elections]] held in the Maldives in 2008. The electoral win marked an end to the preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime and established democracy in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy and the Quest for Consolidation |url=https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/67543305/The_Maldives_From_Dictatorship_to_Constitutional_Democracy_and_the_Quest_for_Consolidation.pdf |journal=The University of Portsmouth Research Portal |via=The University of Portsmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===

==== Efforts against human trafficking ====
In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal=Trafficking in Persons |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, she oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020-2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol. These prompt-yet-substantive changes contributed to the Maldives' upgrade to Tier 2 in the 2021 US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, after several years of being relegated to &quot;Watchlist&quot; status.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Covid-19 pandemic ===
Mariya Didi, under the guidance of His Excellency President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, became a leading face of the Maldivian government's [[COVID-19 pandemic in Maldives|COVID-19 containment effort]] in early 2020. From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=raajje.mv |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mariya Didi''' ([[Maldivian language|Maldivian]]:ﬁâﬁßﬁÉﬁ®ﬁîﬁß ﬁãﬁ©ﬁãﬁ©''';''' born August 18, 1962) is a [[Maldivians|Maldivian]] barrister and politician who served as the Minister of Defense of the Maldives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Minister of Defence Uza.

Mariya Didi, in her capacity as Minister of Defence, oversees a total of 8 critical institutions, namely [[Maldives National Defence Force]] (MNDF), National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=14 February 2019 |title=A special session of Counter Terrorism Steering Committee and Counter Radicalisation committee held |url=https://nctc.gov.mv/events/event68.html |access-date=23 December 2023 |website=Nahonal Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2022-06-12 |title=Disaster risk mitigation, adaptation and resilience are directly linked to the Government‚Äôs overall vision for the defence of Maldives ‚Äì Minister Mariya |url=https://www.gov.mv/en/news-and-communications/hdr |access-date=2023-12-23 |website=gov.mv |publisher=Ministry of Defense |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maldives Customs Service,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Mohamed |first=Naizak |date=17 September 2021 |title=Mariya: Work done by Customs is integral to national security |work=Sun |url=https://en.sun.mv/69180 |access-date=23 December 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maldives Immigration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=26 October 2022 |title=Maldives Immigration hosted the first national level border security symposium |url=https://www.immigration.gov.mv/maldives-border-security-symposium/ |access-date=23 December 2023 |website=Maldives Immigration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=19 November 2022 |title=Minister: AVSECOM‚Äôs biggest challenge ‚Äì having to operate under civil service |work=Sun |url=https://en.sun.mv/79138 |access-date=23 December 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Trafficking in Persons (Anti-TIP),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=30 July 2021 |title=Ministry of Defence issues statement on World Day against Trafficking in Persons 2021 |url=https://www.gov.mv/en/news-and-communications/ministry-of-defence-issues-statement-on-world-day-against-trafficking-in-persons-2021 |access-date=23 December 2023 |website=gov.mv |publisher=Ministry of Defence}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Maldives Hydrographic Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=3rd Joint Hydrographic Survey in Maldives: 19 Jan ‚Äì 26 Feb 2023 |url=https://hci.gov.in/Male/?pdf17706?000 |access-date=23 December 2023 |website=Embassy / High Commission / Consulate General of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi instituted the tradition of engaging regularly with the MNDF leadership and defence sector agencies through weekly plenary meetings and multi-agency sit-downs, where the latest information and updates are exchanged in cross-sector settings.

== Early life and career ==

=== Education ===
Mariya Didi has a bachelor's degree in law (LLB) (Hons) and a master's degree in law (LLB) (Hons) from the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales|Wales, United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; She completed her professional qualifications in England and is among the first two Barristers to be called to the [[Barristers in England and Wales|Bar of England and Wales]], and is a Barrister of the prestigious Gray's Inn, England, having done her pupillage at Albion Chambers, Bristol.

In 2007, she was awarded the [[International Women of Courage Award]] by the [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] for her work promoting [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Handbook of the World 2015 |publisher=SAGE Publications |year=2015 |isbn=9781483371559 |editor-last=Lansford |editor-first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is married to Mr. Mohamed Amir. She has one daughter and two sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

=== Career ===
A former Member of People's Majlis and a leading human rights activist, Mariya Didi is the first female lawyer of the Maldives. As an elected Member of Parliament for 4 consecutive terms, she sat in the Drafting Committee of the [[Constitution of the Maldives#2008 Constitution|2008 Constitution]]. In 2007, she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US Secretary of State in recognition of her contribution to democracy and human rights in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-03-08 |title=Maldivian wins ‚ÄòInternational Woman of Courage‚Äô award |url=https://themdp.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/maldivian-wins-%e2%80%98international-woman-of-courage%e2%80%99-award/ |access-date=2023-10-18 |website=Maldivian Democratic Party |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi was elected as Chairperson of [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] (MDP), the largest political party in the Maldives. Under her chairmanship, the party won their first multiparty democratic [[2008 Maldivian presidential election|presidential elections]] held in the Maldives in 2008. The electoral win marked an end to the preceding 30-year-old authoritarian regime and established democracy in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nazeer |first=Ahmed |date=June 6, 2022 |title=The Maldives: From Dictatorship to Constitutional Democracy and the Quest for Consolidation |url=https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/67543305/The_Maldives_From_Dictatorship_to_Constitutional_Democracy_and_the_Quest_for_Consolidation.pdf |journal=The University of Portsmouth Research Portal |via=The University of Portsmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role in democracy ===
On 7 February 2012, the [[Mohamed Nasheed|then-President Mohamed Nasheed]] of Maldives resigned suddenly in a ‚ÄúCoup d'√©tat‚Äù. On the day of the President's resignation and on the day after, Mariya Didi was beaten by rogue members of the security forces, who had allegedly joined hands with the then Vice President, who succeeded the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=7 February 2012 |title=Maldives president quits after protests |work=Al Jazeera |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/2/7/maldives-president-quits-after-protests |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, Mariya Didi was the spokesperson for President Solih's campaign, and headed its crucial Male‚Äô constituency, where half of the Maldivian population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shaany |first=Aishath |date=4 July 2018 |title=MDP appoints MP Mariya as campaign spokesperson |work=raajje.mv |url=https://raajje.mv/36030 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was run at a time when space for democratic expression and political activity was severely constricted, under the authoritarian rule of [[Abdulla Yameen|President Yameen Abdul Gayoom's]] regime. The regime unlawfully arrested Supreme Court justices, opposition political figures, and detained and disappeared journalists, crushing the nation's democratic institutions and by extension, public confidence in state institutions. Trust in MNDF reached an all-time low as citizens watched soldiers in riot gear storming Majlis chambers, and crudely forcing opposition MPs out of parliamentary sittings. MDP went on to score a resounding victory in the 2018 election, bringing the rule of the dictator to a decisive end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2018-09-22 |title=Maldives election: Ibrahim Mohamed Solih claims victory |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45592375 |access-date=2023-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
In the first year of her tenure, Mariya Didi led an initiative to professionalize, modernize and depoliticize the nation's defence forces to restore  public trust and confidence in MNDF and fortifying civil-military relations. In this regard, some landmark steps include guiding the formulation of MNDF's Capstone Doctrine, designing multiple programmes and endeavours geared towards building MNDF's professionalism, operational capacity and interoperability, and setting up MNDF's first-ever military justice system. Additionally, empowering MNDF's grievance mechanism, launching multiple soldier welfare initiatives, and encouraging forums for democratic debate and dialogue in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=April 22, 2021 |title=MNDF introduces military justice system, rebrands website |work=PSM News |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/84977 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi opened up the defence sector's doors to the press in the spirit of public transparency. Prior to the move, defence sector institutions such as the MNDF had long been known for their limited, only-on-needs-basis interactions with the press, resulting in the defence forces being viewed with mistrust and a culture of secrecy. To democratize the forces, Mariya Didi broke MNDF's alleged tradition of secrecy. She did so by obliging to the summons issued by the parliament's National Security Services (241) committee and their inquiries, in order to respond to the allegations and aspersions cast on the integrity of the nation's defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 6, 2021 |title=LOCAL Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal summoned to Parliament‚Äôs inquiry |work=Maldives News Network |url=https://maldivesnewsnetwork.com/2021/06/06/chief-of-defence-force-major-general-abdulla-shamaal-summoned-to-parliaments-inquiry/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi is recognized for her role in working closely with the National Security Advisors of fellow member states [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], to set a Charter for the Colombo Security Conclave, which began as a trilateral security framework with 4 pillars for security cooperation among the 3 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vasani |first=Krupa |title=India, Maldives and Sri Lanka: Trilateral Cooperation on Maritime Security |work=CESCUBE |url=https://cescube.com/vp-india-maldives-and-sri-lanka-trilateral-cooperation-on-maritime-security |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2021, Mariya Didi became the first Minister from outside India to officiate the [[Passing out (military)|Passing Out Parade]] (POP) - Autumn Term at the [[Indian Naval Academy]] (INA) in [[Ezhimala (hill, Kannur)|Ezhimala]] - Asia's largest naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Agencies |date=November 28, 2021 |title=Defence Minister of Maldives Mariya Ahmed Didi arrives to review the Passing Out Parade. |work=[[The Shillong Times]] |url=https://theshillongtimes.com/2021/11/28/defence-minister-of-maldives-mariya-ahmed-didi-arrives-to-review-the-passing-out-parade/ |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in the military ===
A recipient of the [[International Women of Courage Award|US State Department's International Women of Courage Award]] for her commitment to democracy and human rights, Mariya Didi is widely celebrated for her work to ensure gender equality in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zalif |first=Zunana |date=26 March 2021 |title=Minister Mariya urges wider opportunities for women in military, on sidelines of UNCSW |work=raajje.mv |url=https://raajje.mv/97388 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; At no time in the MNDF's 130-year long history, and in over 3 decades since female soldiers were first recruited to the apex military organization, had its Advisory Council ever had female membership. Mariya Didi initiated the restructuring of the council to allow membership of Lieutenant Colonels and thereafter appointed 2 female Lieutenant Colonels to the council for the first time. These steps were taken as part of a mission to ensure female representation at the highest level of MNDF's decision-making, following the promotion of 3 female officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=21 April 2022 |title=Female officers making unprecedented progress: Defence Minister |work=PSM News |url=https://www.psmnews.mv/en/101625 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariya Didi mandated that all internal committees of MNDF shall have at least one female soldier. In August 2021, MNDF appointed its first-ever Female Information Officer. In early 2021, Lieutenant Firushana Thaufeeg, the first-ever female Maldivian officer cadet to have been sent to the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK returned home to much fanfare, having attained the Best International Student Award from the Short Commissioning Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=February 23, 2022 |title=LIEUTENANT FIRUSHANA THAUFEEQ ACHIEVES THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD PRESENTED TO WOMEN |url=https://www.mndf.gov.mv/mndf/en/news-article.php?article=3843 |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=MNDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, female soldiers are taking on roles traditionally reserved for their male counterparts and gaining increasing visibility as Sergeant Majors, Personal Security Officers (PSOs), Special Protection Group (SPG) agents, honor guards, shooters and firefighters.

=== Efforts against terrorism and violent extremism ===
Mariya Didi is known for her commitment to the Solih administration's efforts to counter Terrorism and Violent Extremism in the country, through the enforcement of its Zero Tolerance Policy on Terrorism and Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Naeem |first=Ibrahim |date=February 14, 2021 |title=Brief on the Maldives‚Äô Efforts on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/ctc/sites/www.un.org.securitycouncil.ctc/files/maldives_efforts_on_ct_and_pcve.pdf |journal=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre |via=Director, National Counter Terrorism Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the Solih administration took the initiative in November 2018 to publicly acknowledge the threat of Terrorism and Violent Extremism for the first time, many proactive steps have been taken at all levels of governance and policy-making to tackle this difficult challenge. These steps include the formulation of the National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Under Mariya Didi's leadership, the National Counter Terrorism Centre played an instrumental role as the Maldives‚Äô national lead agency for coordinating efforts to prevent Terrorism and Violent Extremism through a 'whole-of government' and a 'whole-of-society' approach. The past 3 years, in particular, has seen the centre's national footprint expand and evolve, as evidenced by the many seminars, workshops and mobile intervention programs, in collaboration with local and international partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In December 2019, Mariya Didi was handed the Maldivian government's anti-human trafficking portfolio, which had been placed on the policy backburner for years by the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2020 |url=https://mv.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/Maldives-2020-TIP-Report.pdf |journal=Trafficking in Persons |via=US Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 2 years, she oversaw a series of unprecedented developments including the setting up of the nation's first-ever [rotational] shelter for Victims of Trafficking, its first-ever Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office, and the accompanying appointment of a Director of Anti-Human Trafficking. Additionally, the allocation of federal funding for the anti-human trafficking cause, the formulation of Maldives National Anti-Human Trafficking Action Plan 2020‚Äì2022, and the alignment of the 2013 Anti-Human Trafficking Act with the UN Palermo Protocol.

From March 2020 when the State of Public Health Emergency was first declared, until it scaled down to a Health Emergency in July 2020, Mariya Didi chaired hundreds of critical ‚ÄúEmergency Cell‚Äù meetings at NEOC and oversaw the setting up of many facilities nationwide to deal with the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasheed |first=Hanaan |date=February 1, 2021 |title=Women lead Maldives' Covid-19 response to hopeful shore of immunization |work=raajje.mv |url=https://raajje.mv/94707 |access-date=October 18, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
