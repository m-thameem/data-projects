==Educational background==
Munavvar completed his secondary education in [[Majeedhiyya School]].

Doctor in the Science of Law, 1993, [[Dalhousie University]], Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, Sept. 1990 – Sept. 1993 (full-time) (to be verified);

Master of Laws (LL.M.), 1989, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, Sept. 1988 – Sept. 1989 (full-time) (to be verified);

Legislative Drafting Course, 1986, Bureau of Parliamentary Studies and Training, [[Lok Sabha]] Secretariat, New Delhi, India, [[4 November]] [[1985]] – [[31 January]] [[1986]] (full-time);

==Political career==
He was former MP of [[Addu Atoll]] constituency, with the aid of a voting scam facilitated by the Maldives government. His service as MP favoured only the current regime and bought him much financial prowess. His constituency regards his tenure as a failure.

Munavvar's repertoire is awash with corruption and psychological abuse. Through his associates in the Tourism Ministry, he has facilitated the leasing of numerous properties to his compatriots with funds raised through this endeavour trickling into his accounts at the various Caymans banks. This is a 'secret' that is constantly invoked by the political leftists of the country. In addition to corrupting the business of tourism, Munavvar has violated many a legislature in aiding his minions. One of his more recognized notoriety is the collaboration with drug smugglers of the country. [[Hassan Saeed]], the attorney general who followed in his stead, has attested to this (albeit indirectly).

In June 2007, he was elected the leader of the Maldives' main opposition political party, [[Maldivian Democractic Party]]. This he achieved through numerous falsifications and cynical innuendos. He publicly testified in a speech given to his constituency that he had no knowledge of the wrong-doings undertaken by the government during his 10-year tenure. It should be noted that the apology that followed was the height of his cynicism, and that he cannot excuse himself from a legal inquisition into his involvements with the corruption and injustice. Being a volunteer lecturer at [[Feculty of Shari'ah And Law]] of [[Maldives Collage of Higher Education]], he should recognize this obligation. [[Feculty of Shari'ah And Law]] of [[Maldives Collage of Higher Education]] is the only law school accredited by international universities.

Munavvar was succeeded by Dr.Mohamed Zahir Hussain (who was at the position temporarily) and was preceded by Dr. Hassan Saeed. Dr Munawwar is widely criticized by the general public for being involved in corrupt business deals. His popularity in his own atoll declined due to the fact that he was unable to develop tourism in Addu Atoll during his tenure in public. He has also pressure from MDP to resign from the post of Presidency. There is a rumor that he is awaiting for an instruction from Gasim Ibrahim, former Minister of Finance and Treasury and head of Villa Group of Companies.

==Political career==

Dr.Munavvar served as the attorney general of the Maldives for 10 years. He also served as the MP of Addu constituency for a number of years.

On 5th December 2004 he was charged under the article 29 of the Maldives Penal Code “Acts against the State”.

The opposition and the international community alleged that the charges were politically motivated and subsequently the charges were dropped by the government on 10th December 2004. Political parties were not allowed to operate in the Maldives those days, but political dissidents of the Gayoom’s government formed MDP and Munavvar worked closely with them. On 2nd June 2007 Dr.Munavvar was elected as the president of MDP, the largest opposition party in the Maldives. However, due to poor popularity, he recently lost the election held to nominate a Presidential Candidate of MDP.

On 13th August 2008 Dr.Munavvar resigned from MDP presidency after been failed in MDP presidential primaries 2008, which decided Mohamed Nasheed (Anni) as its presidential Candidate for Maldives first-ever multi-party Presidential election.

With the 57 signatories, election commission gave approval to get 3000 members to the party. in the first attempt to form his party he was failed to gather 300 members as supporters. most of the people of the Maldives believes he is failed in the field of Politics.
='''Supporter'''
 Munavvar as Attorney General changed a lot of things in the amended 1997 constitution to increase the President Maumoon Gayyoom’s power. When Gayyoom removed the clause which stated that the president can only have two terms, Munavvar did not oppose it. This is just one example of many things Munavvar manipulated and twisted when he was Attorney General to further his own and Gayyoom’s interests.
 
Munavvar can also be very petty. He once sentenced one of his neighbours to many years exile to another island, after that man who lives next door to people close to Munavvar accidentally picked a breadfruit from the ‘wrong tree’ because both breadfruit trees in the neighbouring houses had interlocking branches.
 
Munavvar’s relatives decided to forgive the man, but Munavvar who bore a personal grudge against the man, gave him a disproportionately long sentence. This case was reported in the Maldives media but both Maumoon Gayyoom and Munavvar ignored it. This is how Munavvar treats even the weakest among his imagined ‘opponents’. One can guess what torture he will inflict on any person who seriously politically opposes him if he is able to become Maldives’ next dictator after Gayyoom is toppled by the MDP.
 
One similarity between the arrogant Dr Munavvar and paranoid Maumoon Gayyoom is that they both enjoy enslaving the people who work under them. If you fail to be publicly courteous and stand up when Munavvar enters the room, he will be your enemy for life. Munavvar lacks any sense of humanity towards his fellow beings and was even snobbish towards his fellow Cabinet members.
 
At various times he prevented draft bills by the former Labour minister Abdulla Kamaaludhdheen from being heard or read at the People’s Majlis. (Abdulla Kamaaludhdheen is now the Fisheries minister; may Allah protect the fishing industry!)
 
All Maldivians know about Kamaaludhdheen’s intellectual limitations, but bills by any majlis member, regardless of whether he can read and write, at least deserve a hearing.
 
Gayyoom removed Munavvar from the Attorney General’s position in 2003 and offered him another post, but Munavvar declined the offer. It is believed that Gayyoom’s brother and Trade Minister Abdullah Yameen wanted both Zaki and Munavvar removed from cabinet because Yameen saw them as a threat to his own presidential dreams.
 
Zaki and Munavvar never belonged to the core group of the Gayyoom regime, and they had visions of gaining power in the future. Both of them criticised Gayyoom in private gatherings, but in public it was all ‘praise for Gayyoom’. Even in October 2003 during the peak of Gayyoom’s election campaign, Zaki organised a ceremony supposedly to mark an anniversary of national planning in the Maldives, and Gayyoom was invited and gave a speech with maximum publicity. Zaki had organised similar publicity campaigns for Gayyoom on many occasions.
 
As the Attorney General, Munavvar relentlessly prosecuted political dissidents and people with moderate Islamic beliefs who were critical of the regime. His performance at the Sandhaanu prisoners trials, on behalf of Maumoon Gayyoom, was a national and legal disgrace. At the same time, he pulled strings to free his friends who committed all sorts of criminal acts.
 
There is no doubt that both Zaki and Munavvar would be faithful servants in the Gayyoom regime had they not been sidelined. If they had been offered acceptable cabinet portfolios they would have remained supporters of the regime and would not have ‘defected’ to the MDP.
 
As Attorney General, '''Munavvar received an opportunity to work towards constitutional and legal reform but he did nothing with his skills and power for the betterment of Maldives and Maldivians. Instead, he defended a corrupt regime, and ended up a corrupt politician.'''

Munavvar as Attorney General changed a lot of things in the amended 1997 constitution to increase the President Maumoon Gayyoom’s power. When Gayyoom removed the clause which stated that the president can only have two terms, Munavvar did not oppose it. This is just one example of many things Munavvar manipulated and twisted when he was Attorney General to further his own and Gayyoom’s interests.
 
Munavvar can also be very petty. He once sentenced one of his neighbours to many years exile to another island, after that man who lives next door to people close to Munavvar accidentally picked a breadfruit from the ‘wrong tree’ because both breadfruit trees in the neighbouring houses had interlocking branches.
 
Munavvar’s relatives decided to forgive the man, but Munavvar who bore a personal grudge against the man, gave him a disproportionately long sentence. This case was reported in the Maldives media but both Maumoon Gayyoom and Munavvar ignored it. This is how Munavvar treats even the weakest among his imagined ‘opponents’. One can guess what torture he will inflict on any person who seriously politically opposes him if he is able to become Maldives’ next dictator after Gayyoom is toppled by the MDP.
 
One similarity between the arrogant Dr Munavvar and paranoid Maumoon Gayyoom is that they both enjoy enslaving the people who work under them. If you fail to be publicly courteous and stand up when Munavvar enters the room, he will be your enemy for life. Munavvar lacks any sense of humanity towards his fellow beings and was even snobbish towards his fellow Cabinet members.
 
At various times he prevented draft bills by the former Labour minister Abdulla Kamaaludhdheen from being heard or read at the People’s Majlis. (Abdulla Kamaaludhdheen is now the Fisheries minister; may Allah protect the fishing industry!)
 
All Maldivians know about Kamaaludhdheen’s intellectual limitations, but bills by any majlis member, regardless of whether he can read and write, at least deserve a hearing.
 
Gayyoom removed Munavvar from the Attorney General’s position in 2003 and offered him another post, but Munavvar declined the offer. It is believed that Gayyoom’s brother and Trade Minister Abdullah Yameen wanted both Zaki and Munavvar removed from cabinet because Yameen saw them as a threat to his own presidential dreams.
 
Zaki and Munavvar never belonged to the core group of the Gayyoom regime, and they had visions of gaining power in the future. Both of them criticised Gayyoom in private gatherings, but in public it was all ‘praise for Gayyoom’. Even in October 2003 during the peak of Gayyoom’s election campaign, Zaki organised a ceremony supposedly to mark an anniversary of national planning in the Maldives, and Gayyoom was invited and gave a speech with maximum publicity. Zaki had organised similar publicity campaigns for Gayyoom on many occasions.
 
As the Attorney General, Munavvar relentlessly prosecuted political dissidents and people with moderate Islamic beliefs who were critical of the regime. His performance at the Sandhaanu prisoners trials, on behalf of Maumoon Gayyoom, was a national and legal disgrace. At the same time, he pulled strings to free his friends who committed all sorts of criminal acts.
 
There is no doubt that both Zaki and Munavvar would be faithful servants in the Gayyoom regime had they not been sidelined. If they had been offered acceptable cabinet portfolios they would have remained supporters of the regime and would not have ‘defected’ to the MDP.
 
As Attorney General, Munavvar received an opportunity to work towards constitutional and legal reform but he did nothing with his skills and power for the betterment of Maldives and Maldivians. Instead, he defended a corrupt regime, and ended up a corrupt politician.
 
Maldivians will not support Zaki or Munavvar in any government that comes to power. Zaki and Munavvar were part of the backbone of Gayyoom’s corrupt and cruel system until less than a year ago.

This case was reported in the Maldives media but both Maumoon Gayyoom and Munavvar ignored it. This is how Munavvar treats even the weakest among his imagined ‘opponents’. One can guess what torture he will inflict on any person who seriously politically opposes him if he is able to become Maldives’ next dictator after Gayyoom is toppled by the MDP.
 
One similarity between the arrogant Dr Munavvar and paranoid Maumoon Gayyoom is that they both enjoy enslaving the people who work under them. If you fail to be publicly courteous and stand up when Munavvar enters the room, he will be your enemy for life. Munavvar lacks any sense of humanity towards his fellow beings and was even snobbish towards his fellow Cabinet members.
 
At various times he prevented draft bills by the former Labour minister Abdulla Kamaaludhdheen from being heard or read at the People’s Majlis. (Abdulla Kamaaludhdheen is now the Fisheries minister; may Allah protect the fishing industry!)
 
All Maldivians know about Kamaaludhdheen’s intellectual limitations, but bills by any majlis member, regardless of whether he can read and write, at least deserve a hearing.
 
Gayyoom removed Munavvar from the Attorney General’s position in 2003 and offered him another post, but Munavvar declined the offer. It is believed that Gayyoom’s brother and Trade Minister Abdullah Yameen wanted both Zaki and Munavvar removed from cabinet because Yameen saw them as a threat to his own presidential dreams.
 
Zaki and Munavvar never belonged to the core group of the Gayyoom regime, and they had visions of gaining power in the future. Both of them criticised Gayyoom in private gatherings, but in public it was all ‘praise for Gayyoom’. Even in October 2003 during the peak of Gayyoom’s election campaign, Zaki organised a ceremony supposedly to mark an anniversary of national planning in the Maldives, and Gayyoom was invited and gave a speech with maximum publicity. Zaki had organised similar publicity campaigns for Gayyoom on many occasions.
 
As the Attorney General, Munavvar relentlessly prosecuted political dissidents and people with moderate Islamic beliefs who were critical of the regime. His performance at the Sandhaanu prisoners trials, on behalf of Maumoon Gayyoom, was a national and legal disgrace. At the same time, he pulled strings to free his friends who committed all sorts of criminal acts.
 
There is no doubt that both Zaki and Munavvar would be faithful servants in the Gayyoom regime had they not been sidelined. If they had been offered acceptable cabinet portfolios they would have remained supporters of the regime and would not have ‘defected’ to the MDP.
 
As Attorney General, Munavvar received an opportunity to work towards constitutional and legal reform but he did nothing with his skills and power for the betterment of Maldives and Maldivians. Instead, he defended a corrupt regime, and ended up a corrupt politician.
 
Maldivians will not support Zaki or Munavvar in any government that comes to power. Zaki and Munavvar were part of the backbone of Gayyoom’s corrupt and cruel system until less than a year ago.

'''Dr. Mohamed Munavvar''' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. މުޙައްމަދު މުނައްވަރު) was born in the island of [[Meedhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Meedhoo]] in the [[Maldives]]. He was former Attorney General of Maldives.

==Early and personal life==
Born on 02 December 1961, Munavvar spent early days of his life at his native island Meedhoo. In 1971 he came to [[Malé]] for education. Munavvar is married and has 2 daughters and 1 son.

==Educational background==
Munavvar completed his secondary education in [[Majeedhiyya School]].

Doctor in the Science of Law, 1993, [[Dalhousie University]], Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, Sept. 1990 – Sept. 1993 (full-time)
Master of Laws (LL.M.), 1989, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, Sept. 1988 – Sept. 1989 (full-time) (to be verified);

Legislative Drafting Course, 1986, Bureau of Parliamentary Studies and Training, [[Lok Sabha]] Secretariat, New Delhi, India, 4 November 1985 – 31 January 1986 (full-time);

Master of Laws with Honours (LL.M.), with specialization in International Law, 1985, [[Peoples' Friendship University of Russia|Patrice Lumumba People’s Friendship University]], Moscow, Russia, September 1979 – June 1985, (full-time)

==Political career==
Dr. Munavvar served as the attorney general of the Maldives for ten years, until he was dismissed in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Star1&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/08/17/d40817020230.htm Crackdown in the Maldives]&quot;, ''Daily Star'', 17 August 2004, retrieved 2011-08-08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mstar&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/11/12/latest/14897Maldivesp&amp;sec=latest Maldives president sacks reformists after starting sixth term]&quot;, ''[[Malaysia Star]]'', 12 November 2003, retrieved 2011-08-08&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as the MP of Addu constituency for a number of years.

On 13th August 2008 Dr.Munavvar resigned from MDP presidency after been failed in MDP presidential primaries 2008, which decided Mohamed Nasheed (Anni) as its presidential Candidate for Maldives first-ever multi-party Presidential election.
1st of April 2010, Dr.Munavvar applied to Election commission for a party registration. With the 57 signatories, election commission gave approval to get 3000 members to the party. in the first attempt to form his party he was failed to gather 300 members as supporters. most of the people of the Maldives believes he is failed in the field of Politics.
Munavvar as Attorney General changed a lot of things in the amended 1997 constitution to increase the President Maumoon Gayyoom’s power. When Gayyoom removed the clause which stated that the president can only have two terms, Munavvar did not oppose it. This is just one example of many things Munavvar manipulated and twisted when he was Attorney General to further his own and Gayyoom’s interests.
 
Munavvar can also be very petty. He once sentenced one of his neighbours to many years exile to another island, after that man who lives next door to people close to Munavvar accidentally picked a breadfruit from the ‘wrong tree’ because both breadfruit trees in the neighbouring houses had interlocking branches.
 
Munavvar’s relatives decided to forgive the man, but Munavvar who bore a personal grudge against the man, gave him a disproportionately long sentence. This case was reported in the Maldives media but both Maumoon Gayyoom and Munavvar ignored it. This is how Munavvar treats even the weakest among his imagined ‘opponents’. One can guess what torture he will inflict on any person who seriously politically opposes him if he is able to become Maldives’ next dictator after Gayyoom is toppled by the MDP.

If you fail to be publicly courteous and stand up when Munavvar enters the room, he will be your enemy for life. Munavvar lacks any sense of humanity towards his fellow beings and was even snobbish towards his fellow Cabinet members.

All Maldivians know about Kamaaludhdheen’s intellectual limitations, but bills by any majlis member, regardless of whether he can read and write, at least deserve a hearing.
 
Gayyoom removed Munavvar from the Attorney General’s position in 2003 and offered him another post, but Munavvar declined the offer. It is believed that Gayyoom’s brother and Trade Minister Abdullah Yameen wanted both Zaki and Munavvar removed from cabinet because Yameen saw them as a threat to his own presidential dreams.
