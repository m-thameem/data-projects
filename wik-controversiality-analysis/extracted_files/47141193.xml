==Corruption allegations==
In October 2014, an audit report implicated Ahmed Adeeb in a corruption scandal involving US$6million.

The Speaker of the [[People's Majlis]] was involved in leaking the documents to the media, and by the influence of Adeeb, the Speaker's passport was withheld preventing him from leaving the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/court-imposes-travel-restrictions-on-mp-nazim-90621#sthash.5nmEbMY5.dpbs Court imposed travel ban on the Speaker]&lt;/ref&gt; Later on the Auditor General was accused of having released a political audit report and was soon removed from office. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiraajje.com/minister-adeeb-auditor-general-issued-a-political-audit-report.html Accusations against Auditor General]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adeeb has also been widely implicated in the use of the courts and criminal gangs to intimidate opponents of the government including members of the opposition [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/world/asia/maldives-transition-to-democracy-appears-increasingly-precarious.html Maldives’ Transition to Democracy Appears Increasingly Precarious-NY Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Ahmed Adeeb was born and raised in [[Male' City]]. Adeeb is the son of Abdul Ghafoor Adam and Shaheema Mohamed. Adeeb is married with two children.

Ahmed Adeeb attended the iconic [[Majeediyaa School]] for his primary education before receiving his degree from [[Staffordshire University]] in 2007. He received his Master's in Business Administrator Degree from [[Edith Cowan University]] in 2008. 

Adeeb began his career in 2001 at Maldives Customs Services. After graduating in 2008 he started work as the Chief Operating Officer at Millennium Capital Holdings Pvt Ltd, before he got elected as the Treasurer of Maldives National Chamber of Commerce and Industries (MNCCI) the same year. He was later elected as President of the Maldives National Chamber of Commerce and Industries (MNCCI) in 2011. Adeeb stepped into the national spotlight in 2009 as a young academic discussing various economic issues relating to the government. 

==Political career==
After the controversial resignation of President [[Mohamed Nasheed]] on February 7 2012, President Waheed appointed Ahmed Adeeb as Tourism Minister.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haveeru.com.mv/presidnet_waheed/41204&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Abdulla Yameen]] was sworn in as [[President of Maldives]], on November 17, 2013, Ahmed Adeeb was appointed as Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourism.gov.mv/news/reference-is-made-to-the-ministrys-announcement-with-reference-no-iul-88-ls88201329-dated-16th-july-2013/ Mr. Ahmed Adeeb appointed as Minister of Tourism, Arts &amp; Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from being the Tourism Minister, Ahmed Adeeb was also the Co-chair of the Economic Council.

==Vice Presidency rumors==
There were strong rumors that Ahmed Adeeb would be appointed as the new Vice President of Maldives. The Leader of the Parliamentary Group of ruling [[Progressive Party of Maldives]], Ahmed Nihan, stated that Ahmed Adeeb deserves to be Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnm.mv/english/f/?id=9806 Adeeb deserves to be Vice President - PG Leader Ahmed Nihan]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a no-confidence motion submitted against Vice President to the Parliament by the ruling PPM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnm.mv/english/f/?id=9876 VP no confidence motion submitted with support of 61 MPs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice President [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmed]], speaking to ''The New Indian Express'', stated that the no confidence motion filed against him was “a constitutional coup in the guise of constitutional reforms” and called on friends of Maldives to “step in” as “they understand what’s happening.”  Adeeb, widely believed to be Jameel’s replacement, fired back at the interview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miadhu.com/article/en/2681 Tourism Minister Ahmed Adeeb fires back at VP Jameel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption allegations==
In October 2014, an audit report implicated Ahmed Adeeb in a corruption scandal involving US$6million. The auditor general indicated that a loan for US$1million was taken in the guise of making an urgent payment to a foreign party and subsequently loaned the money to a company owned by Adeeb’s father.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/tourism-minister-implicated-in-us6million-corruption-scandal-90723#sthash.yTrWVK8A.83tEF39f.dpuf Adeeb implicated in corruption scandal]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sun.mv/english/25756 Auditor General exposes corruption issues related to Minister Adeeb]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Speaker of the [[People's Majlis]] was involved in leaking the documents to the media, and by the influence of Adeeb, the Speaker's passport was withheld preventing him from leaving the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/court-imposes-travel-restrictions-on-mp-nazim-90621#sthash.5nmEbMY5.dpbs Court imposed travel ban on the Speaker]&lt;/ref&gt; Later on the Auditor General was accused of having released a political audit report and was soon removed from office. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiraajje.com/minister-adeeb-auditor-general-issued-a-political-audit-report.html Accusations against Auditor General]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adeeb has also been widely implicated in the use of the courts and criminal gangs to intimidate opponents of the government including members of the opposition [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/world/asia/maldives-transition-to-democracy-appears-increasingly-precarious.html Maldives’ Transition to Democracy Appears Increasingly Precarious-NY Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, an audit report implicated Ahmed Adeeb in a corruption scandal involving US$6million.

The Speaker of the [[People's Majlis]] was involved in leaking the documents to the media, and by the influence of Adeeb, the Speaker's passport was withheld preventing him from leaving the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/court-imposes-travel-restrictions-on-mp-nazim-90621#sthash.5nmEbMY5.dpbs Court imposed travel ban on the Speaker]&lt;/ref&gt; Later on the Auditor General was accused of having released a political audit report and was soon removed from office. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiraajje.com/minister-adeeb-auditor-general-issued-a-political-audit-report.html Accusations against Auditor General]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adeeb has also been widely implicated in the use of the courts and criminal gangs to intimidate opponents of the government including members of the opposition [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/world/asia/maldives-transition-to-democracy-appears-increasingly-precarious.html Maldives’ Transition to Democracy Appears Increasingly Precarious-NY Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corruption ==
Mr. Adeeb Bro has been implicated in a US$6,000,000 corruption scandal. The audit report that proved these claims also brought to light that Adeeb Bro has also failed to declare assets as per Article 138 of the Constitution.There is currently a never ending investigation run by ACC on Adeeb Bro.

Adeeb Bro, we sincerely hope that the money that was transferred to your father was of more use than it would have been for the development of the country. Thank you for your love and care towards citizens of the Maldives.

==Political career==
After the controversial resignation of President [[Mohamed Nasheed]] on 7 February 2012, President Waheed appointed Adeeb as Tourism Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/presidnet_waheed/41204 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710221430/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/presidnet_waheed/41204 |archive-date=10 July 2015 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Abdulla Yameen]] was sworn in as [[President of Maldives]], on 17 November 2013, Adeeb was appointed as Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture.&lt;ref name=TM1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tourism.gov.mv/21/reference-is-made-to-the-ministrys-announcement-with-reference-no-iul-88-ls88201329-dated-16th-july-2013/ | title=Mr. Ahmed Adeeb Abdul Gafoor was appointed as Minister of Tourism by H.E.

Following the historic decision by the Maldives’ People's Majlis to bring first amendment to the 2007 Constitution by capping the eligibility age for presidency between 30 and 65 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/majlis-amends-constitution-sets-new-age-limits-for-presidency-100091|title=Majlis amends constitution, sets new age-limits for presidency – Minivan News – Archive|website=minivannewsarchive.com|access-date=4 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby paving the way for a “youth” Vice President and the impeachment of Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmed from his vice presidency portfolio, Adeeb was appointed as vice president on 23 July 2015. His appointment was endorsed by the People's Majlis by a record majority of 78 out of 85 votes in favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.mv/en/articles/wJEEp|title=Majlis approves Adeeb as vice president|website=archivemv|language=en|access-date=4 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2015, Adeeb was arrested following the Finifenmaa yacht explosion and was charged with high treason with the Criminal Court of Maldives passing a 15 year prison sentence against him&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ex-vice president of Maldives convicted of bomb attack on president|url=https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/ex-vice-president-convicted-in-plot-to-kill-maldives-president-with-bomb-124756|access-date=2021-12-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Controversies ==
Adeeb was detained by Indian authorities on 1 August 2019 after he arrived illegally by tugboat in the city of [[Thoothukudi]], Tamil Nadu. Indian officials stated that Adeeb was detained because he did not have valid travel documents and did not arrive at a legal port of entry. Adeeb was transferred to the Maldives escorted by the [[Indian Coast Guard]], where he was arrested by Maldivian police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives police arrest ex-vice president Adeeb after India denies entry - Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/south-asia/maldives-police-arrest-ex-vice-president-adeeb-after-india-denies-entry/articleshow/70514649.cms|accessdate=3 August 2019|website=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 2020, Adeeb was sentenced to 20 years in prison, after he pleaded guilty to [[money laundering]] and [[embezzlement]] from the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation along with its managing director, Abdulla Ziyath, who received a prison sentence of 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives ex-vice president gets 20 years for graft|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20201006-maldives-ex-vice-president-gets-20-years-for-graft|accessdate=6 October 2020|website=France 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ex-MMPRC head Ziyath sentenced to 11 years in prison|url=https://en.sun.mv/64300|access-date=2021-12-30|website=SunOnline International|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life ==
{{Primary sources|date=October 2021}}
Adeeb is an avid footballer. He represented club and country in youth age groups.  His love for music led to his sponsorship and event sourcing of the biggest major concert gigs in the Maldives, which included international artist Akon, as well as Bollywood stars and bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=January 7, 2015|title=Adeeb: Priyanka and Akon will join tomorrow|url=https://en.sun.mv/26978|access-date=4 December 2019|website=SunOnline International|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
After the controversial resignation of President [[Mohamed Nasheed]] on 7 February 2012, President Waheed appointed Adeeb as Tourism Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/presidnet_waheed/41204 |title=HaveeruOnline - Approval of Vice president and ministers sent to committee |access-date=10 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710221430/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/presidnet_waheed/41204 |archive-date=10 July 2015 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Abdulla Yameen]] was sworn in as [[President of Maldives]], on 17 November 2013, Adeeb was appointed as Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture.&lt;ref name=TM1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tourism.gov.mv/21/reference-is-made-to-the-ministrys-announcement-with-reference-no-iul-88-ls88201329-dated-16th-july-2013/ | title=Mr. Ahmed Adeeb Abdul Gafoor was appointed as Minister of Tourism by H.E.

Following the historic decision by the Maldives’ People's Majlis to bring first amendment to the 2007 Constitution by capping the eligibility age for presidency between 30 and 65 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/majlis-amends-constitution-sets-new-age-limits-for-presidency-100091|title=Majlis amends constitution, sets new age-limits for presidency – Minivan News – Archive|website=minivannewsarchive.com|access-date=4 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby paving the way for a “youth” Vice President and the impeachment of Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmed from his vice presidency portfolio, Adeeb was appointed as vice president on 23 July 2015. His appointment was endorsed by the People's Majlis by a record majority of 78 out of 85 votes in favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.mv/en/articles/wJEEp|title=Majlis approves Adeeb as vice president|website=archivemv|language=en|access-date=4 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2015, Adeeb was arrested following the Finifenmaa yacht explosion and was charged with high treason with the Criminal Court of Maldives passing a 15 year prison sentence against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ex-vice president of Maldives convicted of bomb attack on president|url=https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/ex-vice-president-convicted-in-plot-to-kill-maldives-president-with-bomb-124756|access-date=2021-12-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sentence was overruled on 20 May 2019 by the High Court of Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=May 20, 2019|title=High Court overturns ruling against Adeeb in Finifenma explosion, orders a retrial|url=https://en.sun.mv/53715|access-date=2021-12-30|website=SunOnline International|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Adeeb was detained by Indian authorities on 1 August 2019 after he arrived illegally by tugboat in the city of [[Thoothukudi]], Tamil Nadu. Indian officials stated that Adeeb was detained because he did not have valid travel documents and did not arrive at a legal port of entry. Adeeb was transferred to the Maldives escorted by the [[Indian Coast Guard]], where he was arrested by Maldivian police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives police arrest ex-vice president Adeeb after India denies entry - Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/south-asia/maldives-police-arrest-ex-vice-president-adeeb-after-india-denies-entry/articleshow/70514649.cms|accessdate=3 August 2019|website=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 2020, Adeeb was sentenced to 20 years in prison, after he pleaded guilty to [[money laundering]] and [[embezzlement]] from the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation along with its managing director, Abdulla Ziyath, who received a prison sentence of 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives ex-vice president gets 20 years for graft|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20201006-maldives-ex-vice-president-gets-20-years-for-graft|accessdate=6 October 2020|website=France 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ex-MMPRC head Ziyath sentenced to 11 years in prison|url=https://en.sun.mv/64300|access-date=2021-12-30|website=SunOnline International|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life ==
{{BLP primary sources|date=October 2021}}
Adeeb is an avid footballer. He represented club and country in youth age groups.  His love for music led to his sponsorship and event sourcing of the biggest major concert gigs in the Maldives, which included international artist Akon, as well as Bollywood stars and bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=January 7, 2015|title=Adeeb: Priyanka and Akon will join tomorrow|url=https://en.sun.mv/26978|access-date=4 December 2019|website=SunOnline International|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Adeeb's father served in the military and his mother worked as an executive at the Maldives Customs Service. Adeeb is married to Mariyam Nashwa and is the father of two children, daughter Eevie and son Izyan, from his previous marriage.

==Political career==
After the controversial resignation of President [[Mohamed Nasheed]] on 7 February 2012, President Waheed appointed Adeeb as Tourism Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Saeed |first=Ahmed Abdullah |date=2 April 2012 |title=Approval of Vice president and ministers sent to committee |work=[[Haveeru Daily]] |url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/presidnet_waheed/41204 |url-status=dead |access-date=10 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710221430/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/presidnet_waheed/41204 |archive-date=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Abdulla Yameen]] was sworn in as [[President of Maldives]], on 17 November 2013, Adeeb was appointed as Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture.&lt;ref name=TM1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tourism.gov.mv/21/reference-is-made-to-the-ministrys-announcement-with-reference-no-iul-88-ls88201329-dated-16th-july-2013/ | title=Mr. Ahmed Adeeb Abdul Gafoor was appointed as Minister of Tourism by H.E.

Following the historic decision by the Maldives’ People's Majlis to bring first amendment to the 2007 Constitution by capping the eligibility age for presidency between 30 and 65 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Naish |first=Ahmed |date=24 June 2015 |title=Majlis amends constitution, sets new age-limits for presidency |work=[[Minivan Daily]] |url=https://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/majlis-amends-constitution-sets-new-age-limits-for-presidency-100091 |access-date=4 December 2019 |via=Minivan News - Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby paving the way for a “youth” Vice President and the impeachment of Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmed from his vice presidency portfolio, Adeeb was appointed as vice president on 23 July 2015.

== Controversies ==
