{{start box}}
Dr Hassan Saeed was appointed as the Attorney-General at the age of 33 years by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom on 11 November 2003. Educated in Pakistan and Malaysia before earning his PhD in the University of Queensland in Australia, Dr Saeed had served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.

A leading member of the New Maldives faction of the governing Maldivian People's Party (DRP), Dr Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr Ahmed Shaheed, a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Open Society Association of Maldives which is committed to creating a modern liberal democracy in the Maldives.

The relatively obscure Dr Saeed was thrust on to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework.

A champion of democracy and human rights, Dr Saeed is credited with overturning the ban imposed by his predecessor, Dr Mohamed Munavvar on the registration of political parties, facilitating the introduction of a multiparty system into the Maldives in June 2005.

Dr Saeed has quickly built a reputation for being a mover and shaker and is among the most ardent supporters of the reform agenda proposed by President Gayoom. Candid and forthright, Dr Saeed is recognised across political spectrum as one of the emerging leaders of the Maldives.

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framwork, penal system and the judiciary. The new Penal Code that he had tabled before the parliament last year is expected to sail through with bipartisan support, as it is seen as achieving a modern synthesis between Islamic Sharia and internationallegal norms.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed, Dr Saeed is also the chief architect of the Roadmap for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006.

Dr Saeed is aslo an advocate of liberal Islam and is the co-author of the book, No Apostasy in Islam.

'''Dr. Hassan Saeed''' ([[Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. ޙަސަން ސަޢީދު) is the present attorney general of Maldives.

{{start box}}
Dr Hassan Saeed was appointed as the Attorney-General at the age of 33 years by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom on [[11 November]] [[2003]]. Educated in Pakistan and Malaysia before earning his PhD in the University of Queensland in Australia, Dr Saeed had served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.

A leading member of the New Maldives faction of the governing Maldivian People's Party (DRP), Dr Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr Ahmed Shaheed, a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Open Society Association of Maldives which is committed to creating a modern liberal democracy in the Maldives.

The relatively obscure Dr Saeed was thrust on to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

A champion of democracy and human rights, Dr Saeed is credited with overturning the ban imposed by his predecessor, Dr Mohamed Munavvar on the registration of political parties, facilitating the introduction of a multiparty system into the Maldives in June 2005.  His other legal opinions and practices have widely strengthened freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and, together with is New Maldivian associates, had lobbied and obtained pardons for the draconian sentences imposed on dissidents prosecuted by his predecessor between 2001-2002.  

Dr Saeed has quickly built a reputation for being a mover and shaker and is among the most ardent supporters of the reform agenda proposed by President Gayoom. Candid and forthright, Dr Saeed is recognised across political spectrum as one of the emerging leaders of the Maldives.

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  The new Penal Code that he had tabled before the parliament last year is expected to sail through with bipartisan support, as it is seen as achieving a modern synthesis between Islamic Sharia and internationallegal norms.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed, Dr Saeed is also the chief architect of the Roadmap for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006.

Dr Saeed is also an advocate of liberal Islam and is the co-author of the book ''No Apostasy in Islam''.

'''Dr. Hassan Saeed''' ([[Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. ޙަސަން ސަޢީދު) was attorney general of Maldives from 11 November 2003 to 5 August 2007.

{{start box}}
Dr Hassan Saeed was appointed as the Attorney-General at the age of 33 years by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom on [[11 November]] [[2003]]. Educated in Pakistan and Malaysia before earning his PhD in the University of Queensland in Australia, Dr Saeed had served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.

A leading member of the New Maldives faction of the governing Maldivian People's Party (DRP), Dr Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr Ahmed Shaheed, a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Open Society Association of Maldives which is committed to creating a modern liberal democracy in the Maldives.

The relatively obscure Dr Saeed was thrust on to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

A champion of democracy and human rights, Dr Saeed is credited with overturning the ban imposed by his predecessor, Dr Mohamed Munavvar on the registration of political parties, facilitating the introduction of a multiparty system into the Maldives in June 2005.  His other legal opinions and practices have widely strengthened freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and, together with is New Maldivian associates, had lobbied and obtained pardons for the draconian sentences imposed on dissidents prosecuted by his predecessor between 2001-2002.  

Dr Saeed has quickly built a reputation for being a mover and shaker and is among the most ardent supporters of the reform agenda proposed by President Gayoom. Candid and forthright, Dr Saeed is recognised across political spectrum as one of the emerging leaders of the Maldives.

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  The new Penal Code that he had tabled before the parliament last year is expected to sail through with bipartisan support, as it is seen as achieving a modern synthesis between Islamic Sharia and international legal norms. The Code is widely seen as a model for Muslim countries. 

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed, Dr Saeed is also the chief architect of the Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006.

Dr Saeed is advocate of liberal Islam and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'' which argues that apostasy is not a punishable offence under Islamic law. 

Dr Saeed is also a Barrister-at-Law in the High Court of Australia. He is also an Advocate and Solicitor in the Rep. of Maldives. 

Dr Saeed, along with Justice Minister Mohamed Jameel Ahmed resigned from cabinet on 5 August 2007 accusing President Maumoon Abdul Qayyoom of deliberately obstructing reform process in the country which Dr Saeed engineered and spearheaded. 

Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Dr Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has setup a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot; 。

'''Dr. Hassan Saeed''' ([[Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. ޙަސަން ސަޢީދު) was attorney general of Maldives from 11 November 2003 to 5 August 2007. He is now standing for the Presidency of the Maldives and is seen by many independent observers as the opposition front runner to sitting President Gayoom.

{{start box}}
Dr Hassan Saeed was appointed as the Attorney-General at the age of 33 years by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom on [[11 November]] [[2003]]. 

Educated in Pakistan (At Khawaarij school of Salafia ) and Malaysia before earning his PhD in the University of Queensland in Australia, Dr Saeed had served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General. Hassan has been quoted as saying that he had a tough childhood and has put his success down to hard work and not to privilege or cronyism or family connections. 

In his newly launched Presidential campaign he claims that it was being provided with the opportunity to succeed that made the difference to him, and that all Maldivians have the right to such an opportunity too.

A leading member of the New Maldives faction of the governing Maldivian People's Party (DRP), Dr Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr Ahmed Shaheed, a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Open Society Association of Maldives which is committed to creating a modern liberal democracy in the Maldives.

A reformer and champion of democracy and human rights, Dr Saeed is credited with overturning the ban imposed by his predecessor, Dr Mohamed Munavvar on the registration of political parties, facilitating the introduction of a multiparty system into the Maldives in June 2005.

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  The new Penal Code that he had tabled before the parliament last year is expected to sail through with bipartisan support, as it is seen as achieving a modern synthesis between Islamic Sharia and international legal norms. The Code is widely seen as a model for Muslim countries. 

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed, Dr Saeed is also the chief architect of the Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006.

A Madrasa student and Islamic Scholar, Dr Saeed is advocate of liberal Islam and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'' which argues that apostasy is not a punishable offence under Islamic law. In his presidential campaign Hassan has said that he will will defend the muslim faith from becoming fractured by radicalism or politicization.

Dr Saeed is also a Barrister-at-Law in the High Court of Australia. He is also an Advocate and Solicitor in the Rep. of Maldives. 

Dr Saeed, along with Justice Minister Mohamed Jameel Ahmed resigned from cabinet on 5 August 2007 accusing President Maumoon Abdul Qayyoom of deliberately obstructing reform process in the country which Dr Saeed engineered and spearheaded. Many saw this as an act of principle from a man who attempted to reform the system but who left the cabinet to continue to campaign for that reform.

Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Dr Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has setup a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot; .

Dr Saeed is currently campaigning for the Presidency of Maldives and it expected to be the front runner of the opposition when the Presidential elections are held.

At the time of of his manifesto launch he stated he was not in debt to big business, has no relatives in politics and is not a member of a political party. He contrasted this to the position of Gayoom and other politicians. His policy platform posed a clear choice:

''&quot;This year we are faced with stark choices, between real change or the tired old policies of an outdated regime, between an open and fair Islamic democracy or corruption, nepotism and a fracturing of the faith, between progress and prosperity for all or a slow decline into distrust and instability. You have the chance to make a difference. Make sure you grab this opportunity and vote for a better Maldives.&quot;''

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  The new Penal Code that he had tabled before the parliament last year is expected to sail through with bipartisan support, as it is seen as achieving a modern synthesis between [[Islamic]] [[Sharia]] and international legal norms. The Code is widely seen as a model for Muslim countries. 

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister [[Mohamed Nasheed]], Dr. Saeed is also the chief architect of the Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006.

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Dr. Saeed is advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'' which argues that [[apostasy]] is not a punishable offence under Islamic law. In his presidential campaign, Hassan has said that he will will defend the Muslim faith from becoming fractured by radicalism or politicization.

Dr. Saeed is also a [[Barrister-at-Law]] in the [[High Court of Australia]]. He is also an Advocate and Solicitor in the Republic of Maldives. 

Dr. Saeed, along with Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmed]] resigned from cabinet on [[5 August]] [[2007]] accusing President [[Maumoon Abdul Qayyoom]] of deliberately obstructing reform process in the country which Dr. Saeed engineered and spearheaded. Many saw this as an act of principle from a man who attempted to reform the system but who left the cabinet to continue to campaign for that reform.

Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Dr. Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has setup a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot; .

Dr. Saeed is currently campaigning for the Presidency of Maldives and it expected to be the front runner of the opposition when the Presidential elections are held.

At the time of of his manifesto launch he stated he was not in debt to big business, has no relatives in politics and is not a member of a political party. He contrasted this to the position of Gayoom and other politicians. His policy platform posed a clear choice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;This year we are faced with stark choices, between real change or the tired old policies of an outdated regime, between an open and fair Islamic democracy or corruption, nepotism and a fracturing of the faith, between progress and prosperity for all or a slow decline into distrust and instability. You have the chance to make a difference. Make sure you grab this opportunity and vote for a better Maldives.&quot;

A reformer and champion of democracy and human rights, Dr. Saeed is credited with overturning the ban imposed by his predecessor, Dr. [[Mohamed Munavvar]] on the registration of political parties, facilitating the introduction of a multiparty system into the Maldives in June 2005.  His other legal opinions and practices have widely strengthened freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and, together with is New Maldivian associates, had lobbied and obtained pardons for the draconian sentences imposed on [[dissidents]] prosecuted by his predecessor between 2001-2002.  

Dr. Saeed is among the most ardent supporters of the reform agenda proposed by President Gayoom. {{Fact|date=February 2008}} Candid and forthright, Dr. Saeed is recognised across political spectrum as one of the emerging leaders of the Maldives.

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  The new Penal Code that he had tabled before the parliament last year is expected to sail through with bipartisan support, as it is seen as achieving a modern synthesis between [[Islamic]] [[Sharia]] and international legal norms. The Code is widely seen as a model for Muslim countries. 

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister [[Mohamed Nasheed]], Dr. Saeed is also the chief architect of the Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006.

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Dr. Saeed is advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'' which argues that [[apostasy]] is not a punishable offence under Islamic law. In his presidential campaign, Hassan has said that he will will defend the Muslim faith from becoming fractured by radicalism or politicization.

Dr. Saeed is also a [[Barrister-at-Law]] in the [[High Court of Australia]]. He is also an Advocate and Solicitor in the Republic of Maldives. 

Dr. Saeed, along with Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmed]] resigned from cabinet on [[5 August]] [[2007]] accusing President [[Maumoon Abdul Qayyoom]] of deliberately obstructing reform process in the country which Dr. Saeed engineered and spearheaded. Many saw this as an act of principle from a man who attempted to reform the system but who left the cabinet to continue to campaign for that reform.

Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Dr. Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has setup a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot; .

Dr. Saeed is currently campaigning for the Presidency of Maldives and it expected to be the front runner of the opposition when the Presidential elections are held.

At the time of of his manifesto launch he stated he was not in debt to big business, has no relatives in politics and is not a member of a political party. He contrasted this to the position of Gayoom and other politicians. His policy platform posed a clear choice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;This year we are faced with stark choices, between real change or the tired old policies of an outdated regime, between an open and fair Islamic democracy or corruption, nepotism and a fracturing of the faith, between progress and prosperity for all or a slow decline into distrust and instability. You have the chance to make a difference. Make sure you grab this opportunity and vote for a better Maldives.This mans is someone who will wipe out islamic faith from the mMaldives. So  Maldivians who loves this country must be aware of his dirty deeds. Disguised as an educated islamic scholar and as a reformist. This man can be called as Kamal Ata Turk OF maldives. For further proof read his book Freedom of religon and Apostasy in Islam&quot;

[[Image:Dr_Hassan_Saeed.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Dr Hassan Saeed]]
Dr. Hassan Saeed''' ([[Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. ޙަސަން ސަޢީދު) was [[attorney-general]] of the [[Maldives]] from [[11 November]] [[2003]] to [[5 August]] [[2007]]. He is now standing for the Presidency of the Maldives and is seen by many independent observers as the opposition front runner to sitting President Gayoom.

{{start box}}
Dr Hassan Saeed was appointed as the Attorney-General at the age of 33 years by President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] on [[11 November]]  [[2003]]. 

==Education==
Educated in [[Pakistan]] at Khawaarij school of Salafia and [[Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Dr. Saeed had served as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General. Hassan has been quoted as saying that he had a tough childhood and has put his success down to hard work and not to privilege or cronyism or family connections. His brother Professor Abdulla Saeed gave all the assistance for him to do his PhD.

In his newly launched Presidential campaign he claims that it was being provided with the opportunity to succeed that made the difference to him, and that all Maldivians have the right to such an opportunity too.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

==Political Career==
A leading member of the New Maldives faction of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Dr Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs, the [[Open Society Association of Maldives]] which is committed to creating a modern liberal democracy in the Maldives.

Dr. Saeed was thrust on to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

A reformer and champion of democracy and human rights, Dr. Saeed is credited with overturning the ban imposed by his predecessor, Dr. [[Mohamed Munavvar]] on the registration of political parties, facilitating the introduction of a multiparty system into the Maldives in June 2005.  His other legal opinions and practices have widely strengthened freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and, together with is New Maldivian associates, had lobbied and obtained pardons for the draconian sentences imposed on [[dissidents]] prosecuted by his predecessor between 2001-2002.  

Dr. Saeed is among the most ardent supporters of the reform agenda proposed by President Gayoom. {{Fact|date=February 2008}} Candid and forthright, Dr. Saeed is recognised across political spectrum as one of the emerging leaders of the Maldives.

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  The new Penal Code that he had tabled before the parliament last year is expected to sail through with bipartisan support, as it is seen as achieving a modern synthesis between [[Islamic]] [[Sharia]] and international legal norms. The Code is widely seen as a model for Muslim countries. 

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister [[Mohamed Nasheed]], Dr. Saeed is also the chief architect of the Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006.

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Dr. Saeed is advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'' which argues that [[apostasy]] is not a punishable offence under Islamic law. In his presidential campaign, Hassan has said that he will will defend the Muslim faith from becoming fractured by radicalism or politicization.

Dr. Saeed is also a [[Barrister-at-Law]] in the [[High Court of Australia]]. He is also an Advocate and Solicitor in the Republic of Maldives. 

Dr. Saeed, along with Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmed]] resigned from cabinet on [[5 August]] [[2007]] accusing President [[Maumoon Abdul Qayyoom]] of deliberately obstructing reform process in the country which Dr. Saeed engineered and spearheaded. Many saw this as an act of principle from a man who attempted to reform the system but who left the cabinet to continue to campaign for that reform.

Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Dr. Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has setup a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot; .

Dr. Saeed is currently campaigning for the Presidency of Maldives and it expected to be the front runner of the opposition when the Presidential elections are held.

At the time of of his manifesto launch he stated he was not in debt to big business, has no relatives in politics and is not a member of a political party. He contrasted this to the position of Gayoom and other politicians. His policy platform posed a clear choice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;This year we are faced with stark choices, between real change or the tired old policies of an outdated regime, between an open and fair Islamic democracy or corruption, nepotism and a fracturing of the faith, between progress and prosperity for all or a slow decline into distrust and instability. You have the chance to make a difference. Make sure you grab this opportunity and vote for a better Maldives.This mans is someone who will wipe out islamic faith from the mMaldives. So  Maldivians who loves this country must be aware of his dirty deeds. Disguised as an educated islamic scholar and as a reformist. This man can be called as Kamal Ata Turk OF maldives. For further proof read his book Freedom of religon and Apostasy in Islam&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. Saeed resigned together with Mr. Jameel following the controversial debate, assuming that Mr. gayyoom's presidency is going to end, and he was hoping that he could gather public support, however it is to be proved yet his assumptions are correct.

Dr. Saeed is among the most ardent supporters of the reform agenda proposed by President Gayoom. {{Fact|date=February 2008}} Candid and forthright, Dr. Saeed is recognised across political spectrum as one of the emerging leaders of the Maldives.

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  Saeed tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Dr. Saeed is advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostacy and practice prevailing in Muslim community.

Dr. Saeed is also a [[Barrister-at-Law]] in the [[High Court of Australia]]. He is also an Advocate and Solicitor in the Republic of Maldives. 

Dr. Saeed, along with Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmed]] resigned from cabinet on [[5 August]] [[2007]] accusing President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] of deliberately obstructing reform process in the country which Dr. Saeed engineered and spearheaded. Many saw this as an act of principle from a man who attempted to reform the system but who left the cabinet to continue to campaign for that reform.

Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Dr. Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has setup a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot; .

At the time of of his manifesto launch he stated he was not in debt to big business, has no relatives in politics and is not a member of a political party. He contrasted this to the position of Gayoom and other politicians. His policy platform posed a clear choice:

'''Dr. Hassan Saeed''' ([[Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. ޙަސަން ސަޢީދު) was [[attorney-general]] of the [[Maldives]] from [[11 November]] [[2003]] to [[5 August]] [[2007]]. He is currently running as an idependent candidate for the Presidency of the Maldives.

{{start box}}
Dr Hassan Saeed was appointed as the Attorney-General at the age of 33 by President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] on [[11 November]]  [[2003]]. 

==Education==
Educated in [[Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Dr. Saeed had served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.

==Political Career==
A leading member of the New Maldives faction of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Dr Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs, the [[Open Society Association of Maldives]].

Dr. Saeed was thrust in to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Dr. Saeed is among the most ardent supporters of the reform agenda proposed by President Gayoom. {{Fact|date=February 2008}} Candid and forthright, Dr. Saeed is recognised across political spectrum as one of the emerging leaders of the Maldives.

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  Saeed tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament. 

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister [[Mohamed Nasheed]], Dr. Saeed is also the chief architect of the Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006.{{fact|date=May 2008}}

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Dr. Saeed is advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostacy and practice prevailing in Muslim community.

Dr. Saeed is also a [[Barrister-at-Law]] in the [[High Court of Australia]]. He is also an Advocate and Solicitor in the Republic of Maldives. 

Dr. Saeed, along with Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmed]] resigned from cabinet on [[5 August]] [[2007]] accusing President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] of deliberately obstructing reform process in the country which Dr. Saeed engineered and spearheaded. Many saw this as an act of principle from a man who attempted to reform the system but who left the cabinet to continue to campaign for that reform.

Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Dr. Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has setup a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot; .

At the time of of his manifesto launch he stated he was not in debt to big business, has no relatives in politics and is not a member of a political party. He contrasted this to the position of Gayoom and other politicians. His policy platform posed a clear choice:

The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl|Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

Dr. Saeed was thrust in to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Dr Hassan Saeed.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Dr. Hassan Saeed]] --&gt;
'''Dr. Hassan Saeed''' ([[Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. ޙަސަން ސަޢީދު) was [[attorney-general]] of the [[Maldives]] from 11 November 2003 to 5 August 2007. He ran as an independent candidate for the Presidency of the Maldives, and placed third of six candidates. Dr Hassan Saeed was appointed as the Attorney-General at the age of 33 by President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] on 11 November 2003.

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Dr. Saeed had served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General and he is a well educated man.

==Political career==
===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the [[New Maldives faction]] of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Dr Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl|Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

Dr. Saeed was thrust in to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Dr. Saeed is among the most ardent supporters of the reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. Candid and forthright, Dr. Saeed is recognized across political spectrum as one of the emerging leaders of the Maldives.

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  Saeed tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister [[Mohamed Nasheed]], Dr. Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 7 years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Dr Hassan Saeed and Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl|Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]] resigned from the government in a massive blow for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007 2.30pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at [[Daabaurgue]] for press conference just after 3.30 pm accusing Gayoom, Hassan Saeed said quote “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Dr. Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

===Presidential Bid===
[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom's]] defected [[New maldives]] trio with Dr. Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as a independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate choose [[ahmed shaheed|Dr Ahmed Shaheed]] as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4976 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his manifesto launch he stated he was not in debt to big business, has no relatives in politics and is not a member of a political party. He contrasted this to the position of Gayoom and other politicians. His policy platform posed a clear choice.

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Dr. Saeed is advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah | coauthors = Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Hassan Saeed''' ([[Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. ޙަސަން ސަޢީދު) was [[attorney-general]] of the [[Maldives]] from 11 November 2003 to 5 August 2007. He ran as an independent candidate for the Presidency of the Maldives, and placed third of six candidates. Dr Hassan Saeed was appointed as the Attorney-General at the age of 33 by President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] on 11 November 2003.
[[Image:Hassan Saeed.jpg|310px|thumb|right|Dr. Hassan Saeed during the second round of the [[Maldivian presidential election, 2008]]|{{deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 18 March 2009}}]]

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Dr. Saeed had served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General and he is a well educated man.

==Political career==
===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the [[New Maldives faction]] of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Dr Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl|Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

Dr. Saeed was thrust in to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Dr. Saeed is among the most ardent supporters of the reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. Candid and forthright, Dr. Saeed is recognized across political spectrum as one of the emerging leaders of the Maldives.

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  Saeed tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister [[Mohamed Nasheed]], Dr. Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 7 years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Dr Hassan Saeed and Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl|Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]] resigned from the government in a massive blow for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007 2.30pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at [[Daabaurgue]] for press conference just after 3.30 pm accusing Gayoom, Hassan Saeed said quote “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Dr. Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Dr. Saeed had served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General and he is a well educated man.

==Political career==
===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the [[New Maldives faction]] of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Dr Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl|Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

Dr. Saeed was thrust in to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Dr. Saeed is among the most ardent supporters of the reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. Candid and forthright, Dr. Saeed is recognized across political spectrum as one of the emerging leaders of the Maldives.

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  Saeed tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Dr. Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 7 years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Dr Hassan Saeed and Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl|Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]] resigned from the government in a massive blow for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007 2.30pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at [[Daabaurgue]] for press conference just after 3.30 pm accusing Gayoom, Hassan Saeed said quote “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Dr. Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

===Presidential Bid===
[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom's]] defected [[New maldives]] trio with Dr. Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as a independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate choose [[ahmed shaheed|Dr Ahmed Shaheed]] as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4976 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his manifesto launch he stated he was not in debt to big business, has no relatives in politics and is not a member of a political party. He contrasted this to the position of Gayoom and other politicians. His policy platform posed a clear choice.

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Dr. Saeed is advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah | coauthors = Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He ran as an independent candidate for the Presidency of the Maldives, and placed third of six candidates. Dr Hassan Saeed was appointed as the Attorney-General at the age of 33 by President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] on 11 November 2003.
[[Image:Hassan Saeed.jpg|310px|thumb|right|Dr. Hassan Saeed during the second round of the [[Maldivian presidential election, 2008]]|{{deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 18 March 2009}}]]

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Dr. Saeed had served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General and he is a well educated man.

==Political career==
===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the [[New Maldives faction]] of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Dr Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl|Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

Dr. Saeed was thrust in to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Dr. Saeed is among the most ardent supporters of the reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. Candid and forthright, Dr. Saeed is recognized across political spectrum as one of the emerging leaders of the Maldives.

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  Saeed tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Dr. Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 7 years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Dr Hassan Saeed and Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl|Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]] resigned from the government in a massive blow for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007 2.30pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at [[Daabaurgue]] for press conference just after 3.30 pm accusing Gayoom, Hassan Saeed said quote “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Dr. Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Dr. Saeed had served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General and he is a well educated man.

==Political career==
===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the [[New Maldives faction]] of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Dr Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl|Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

Dr. Saeed was thrust in to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Dr. Saeed is among the most ardent supporters of the reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]].

The Criminal Justice System Action Plan that he produced in March 2005 is a five-year plan to completely overhaul the country's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary.  Saeed tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Dr. Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 7 years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Dr Hassan Saeed and Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl|Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]] resigned from the government in a massive blow for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007 2.30pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at [[Daabaurgue]] for press conference just after 3.30 pm accusing Gayoom, Hassan Saeed said quote “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Dr. Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Dr Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

===Presidential Bid===
[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom's]] defected [[New maldives]] trio with Dr. Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as an independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate choose [[ahmed shaheed|Dr Ahmed Shaheed]] as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4976 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his manifesto launch he stated he was not in debt to big business, has no relatives in politics and is not a member of a political party. He contrasted this to the position of Gayoom and other politicians. His policy platform posed a clear choice.

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Dr. Saeed is advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah | coauthors = Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Dr. Saeed had served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General and he is a well educated man.

==Political career==
===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the [[New Maldives faction]] of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Dr Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl|Dr. Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Saeed served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.

==Political career==
===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the [[New Maldives faction]] of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

Saeed was thrust in to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Saeed supported a reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. He proposed a 5-year plan to reform the criminal justice system, beginning 2005, to overhaul the nation's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary. He tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 7 years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Saeed and Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]] resigned from the government in what was viewed as a setback for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007 2.30pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at [[Daabaurgue]] for a press conference just after 3.30 pm. Accusing Gayoom of misdeeds, Hassan Saeed said “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

===Presidential Bid===
[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom's]] defected [[New maldives]] trio with Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as an independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate chose [[ahmed shaheed|Ahmed Shaheed]] as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4976 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Saeed is an advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in the Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah | coauthors = Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed has argued in the newspaper ''Indian Express'' that Islamic anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, along with increasing Internet access to the Maldives, has caused a shift towards greater fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=twsJanI212&gt;{{cite news

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Saeed served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.

==Political career==
===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the [[New Maldives faction]] of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

Saeed was thrust in to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Saeed supported a reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. He proposed a 5-year plan to reform the criminal justice system, beginning 2005, to overhaul the nation's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary. He tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 7 years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Saeed and Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]] resigned from the government in what was viewed as a setback for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007 2.30pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at [[Daabaurgue]] for a press conference just after 3.30 pm. Accusing Gayoom of misdeeds, Hassan Saeed said “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

===Presidential Bid===
[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom's]] defected [[New maldives]] trio with Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as an independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate chose [[ahmed shaheed|Ahmed Shaheed]] as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4976 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Saeed is an advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in the Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah | coauthors = Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed has argued in the newspaper ''Indian Express'' that Islamic anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, along with increasing Internet access to the Maldives, has caused a shift towards greater fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=twsJanI212&gt;{{cite news

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Saeed served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.

==Political career==

===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the [[New Maldives faction]] of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

Saeed was thrust in to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Saeed supported a reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. He proposed a 5-year plan to reform the criminal justice system, beginning 2005, to overhaul the nation's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary. He tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 7 years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Saeed and Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]] resigned from the government in what was viewed as a setback for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007, 2:30 pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at [[Daabaurgue]] for a press conference just after 3:30 pm. Accusing Gayoom of misdeeds, Hassan Saeed said “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

===Presidential Bid===
[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom's]] defected [[New maldives]] trio with Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as an independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate chose [[ahmed shaheed|Ahmed Shaheed]] as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4976 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Saeed is an advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in the Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah | coauthors = Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed has argued in the newspaper ''Indian Express'' that Islamic anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, along with increasing Internet access to the Maldives, has caused a shift towards greater fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=twsJanI212&gt;{{cite news

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 7 years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Saeed and Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]] resigned from the government in what was viewed as a setback for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007, 2:30 pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at [[Daabaurgue]] for a press conference just after 3:30 pm. Accusing Gayoom of misdeeds, Hassan Saeed said “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Saeed is an advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in the Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah | coauthors = Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed has argued in the newspaper ''Indian Express'' that Islamic anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, along with increasing Internet access to the Maldives, has caused a shift towards greater fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=twsJanI212&gt;{{cite news

A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Saeed is an advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in the Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah |author2=Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed has argued in the newspaper ''Indian Express'' that Islamic anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, along with increasing Internet access to the Maldives, has caused a shift towards greater fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=twsJanI212&gt;{{cite news

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Saeed served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.

==Political career==

===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the [[New Maldives faction]] of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

Saeed was thrust in to the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Saeed supported a reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. He proposed a 5-year plan to reform the criminal justice system, beginning 2005, to overhaul the nation's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary. He tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 7 years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Saeed and Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]] resigned from the government in what was viewed as a setback for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007, 2:30 pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at [[Daabaurgue]] for a press conference just after 3:30 pm. Accusing Gayoom of misdeeds, Hassan Saeed said “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

===Presidential Bid===

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Saeed served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.

==Political career==

===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the [[New Maldives faction]] of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

Saeed was thrust into the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Saeed supported a reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. He proposed a 5-year plan to reform the criminal justice system, beginning 2005, to overhaul the nation's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary. He tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 4 and half years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Saeed and Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]] resigned from the government in what was viewed as a setback for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007, 2:30 pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at [[Daabaurgue]] for a press conference just after 3:30 pm. Accusing Gayoom of misdeeds, Hassan Saeed said “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

===Presidential Bid===
[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom's]] defected [[New maldives]] trio with Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as an independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate chose [[ahmed shaheed|Ahmed Shaheed]] as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4976 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Saeed is an advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in the Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah |author2=Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed has argued in the newspaper ''Indian Express'' that Islamic anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, along with increasing Internet access to the Maldives, has caused a shift towards greater fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=twsJanI212&gt;{{cite news

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Saeed served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.

==Political career==

===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the [[New Maldives faction]] of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]].

Saeed was thrust into the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Saeed supported a reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. He proposed a 5-year plan to reform the criminal justice system, beginning 2005, to overhaul the nation's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary. He tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 4 and half years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Saeed and Justice Minister [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl]] resigned from the government in what was viewed as a setback for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007, 2:30 pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at [[Daabaurgue]] for a press conference just after 3:30 pm. Accusing Gayoom of misdeeds, Hassan Saeed said “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

===Presidential Bid===
[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom's]] defected [[New maldives]] trio with Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as an independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate chose [[ahmed shaheed|Ahmed Shaheed]] as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;.
[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4976 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;  He came third behind the incumbent President Gayyoom and Mr. Nasheed, Maldivian Democratic Party Candidate. With Saeed's backing in the second of election, Mr Nasheed was able to bring to an end of the 30 year rule of Gayyoom.

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Saeed is an advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in the Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah |author2=Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed has argued in the newspaper ''Indian Express'' that Islamic anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, along with increasing Internet access to the Maldives, has caused a shift towards greater fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=twsJanI212&gt;{{cite news

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Saeed served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.

==Political career==

===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the New Maldives faction of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl.

Saeed was thrust into the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Saeed supported a reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. He proposed a 5-year plan to reform the criminal justice system, beginning 2005, to overhaul the nation's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary. He tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 4 and half years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Saeed and Justice Minister Mohamed Jameel Ahmed resigned from the government in what was viewed as a setback for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007, 2:30 pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at Daabaurgue for a press conference just after 3:30 pm. Accusing Gayoom of misdeeds, Hassan Saeed said “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

===Presidential Bid===
[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom's]] defected New Maldives trio with Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as an independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate chose Ahmed Shaheed as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;.
[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4976 Minivan News]&lt;/ref&gt;  He came third behind the incumbent President Gayyoom and Mr. Nasheed, Maldivian Democratic Party Candidate. With Saeed's backing in the second of election, Mr Nasheed was able to bring to an end of the 30 year rule of Gayyoom.

In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah |author2=Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed has argued in the newspaper ''Indian Express'' that Islamic anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, along with increasing Internet access to the Maldives, has caused a shift towards greater fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=twsJanI212&gt;{{cite news

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]], Saeed served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.

==Political career==
===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the New Maldives faction of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mohamed Jameel Ahmedl.

Saeed was thrust into the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Saeed supported a reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. He proposed a 5-year plan to reform the criminal justice system, beginning 2005, to overhaul the nation's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary. He tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 |title=Minivan News |access-date=2008-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415081518/http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 |archive-date=2008-04-15 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 4 and half years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Saeed and Justice Minister Mohamed Jameel Ahmed resigned from the government in what was viewed as a setback for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007, 2:30 pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at Daabaurgue for a press conference just after 3:30 pm. Accusing Gayoom of misdeeds, Hassan Saeed said “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

===Presidential Bid===
[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom's]] defected New Maldives trio with Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as an independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate chose Ahmed Shaheed as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;.
[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4976 Minivan News]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He came third behind the incumbent President Gayyoom and Mr. Nasheed, Maldivian Democratic Party Candidate. With Saeed's backing in the second of election, Mr Nasheed was able to bring to an end of the 30 year rule of Gayyoom.

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Saeed is an advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in the Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah |author2=Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed has argued in the newspaper ''Indian Express'' that Islamic anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, along with increasing Internet access to the Maldives, has caused a shift towards greater fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=twsJanI212&gt;{{cite news

==Education==
Educated in [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] before earning his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]],{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} Saeed served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

==Political career==
===New Maldives Trio===
A leading member of the New Maldives faction of the governing [[Maldivian People's Party]] (DRP), Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. [[Ahmed Shaheed]], a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mohamed Jameel Ahmed.

Saeed was thrust into the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system.

Saeed supported a reform agenda proposed by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]]. He proposed a 5-year plan to reform the criminal justice system, beginning 2005, to overhaul the nation's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary. He tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament.

Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not [[Mohamed Nasheed]]), Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|President Gayoom]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 |title=Minivan News |access-date=2008-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415081518/http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=3492 |archive-date=2008-04-15 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the defected faction===
After 4 and half years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Saeed and Justice Minister Mohamed Jameel Ahmed resigned from the government in what was viewed as a setback for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007, 2:30 pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at Daabaurgue for a press conference just after 3:30 pm. Accusing Gayoom of misdeeds, Hassan Saeed said “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Minivan News&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called &quot;Raajje Chambers&quot;.

===Presidential Bid===
[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom's]] defected New Maldives trio with Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as an independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate chose Ahmed Shaheed as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;.
[http://www.minivannews.com/news/news.php?id=4976 Minivan News]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He came third behind the incumbent President Gayyoom and Mr. Nasheed, Maldivian Democratic Party Candidate. With Saeed's backing in the second of election, Mr Nasheed was able to bring to an end of the 30 year rule of Gayyoom.

==Islam==
A [[madrasa]] student and Islamic Scholar, Saeed is an advocate of liberal [[Islam]] and is the co-author of the book ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam'', a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in the Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saeed | first = Abdullah |author2=Hassan Saeed | year = 2004 | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | isbn = 0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed has argued in the newspaper ''Indian Express'' that Islamic anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, along with increasing Internet access to the Maldives, has caused a shift towards greater fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=twsJanI212&gt;{{cite news

'''Dr. Hassan Saeed''' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. ޙަސަން ސަޢީދު) was the former [[Attorney General (Maldives)|Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives]], a role in which he served from November 11, 2003 to August 5, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Attorney General's Office |url=http://agoffice.gov.mv/#/Attorney%20General/Former%20Attorneys%20General |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=agoffice.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is the current managing partner of [http://chambersinn.com.mv Chambers Inn], a leading corporate law firm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://maldivesbarcouncil.org/ |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=Bar Council of the Maldives |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He is also the Managing Director of [https://www.property.mv Premier Property Pvt Ltd], the country’s leading real estate management, sales, and rental company. 

Prior to establishing his own law firm and his transition into the world of real estate and corporate law, Dr. Saeed led a long political and legal career in the government of the Republic of Maldives. In 1996, he served as a State Attorney, and after completing his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate in law]] at the [https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2003/05/uq-awards-honorary-doctorate-former-governor-general University of Queensland (Australia)] and serving as the Chief Judge of the [http://www.criminalcourt.gov.mv Criminal Court] and the [https://juvenilecourt.gov.mv Juvenile Court], was appointed to the position of [[Attorney General (Maldives)|Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives]] in 2003, a position in which he served until mid-2007. 

As the Attorney General, Dr. Saeed served as the chief legal advisor to the Maldivian government and led a long series of reforms to completely overhaul the island chain’s archaic politico-legal system and transform it into that of a functional liberal democracy. These reforms took much of their inspiration from the legal systems of modern Western democracies while maintaining a deep connection to Islamic law and local traditions. 

In June 2007, Dr. Saeed resigned&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2007-08-05 |title=Maldives officials quit, say president blocks reform |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-28831620070805 |access-date=2022-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the post of the Attorney General when he realized the government was not sincere in the reform process and was slowing and even trying to reverse the reform process.

He also served as an advisor to two different presidents, [[Mohamed Nasheed|President Mohamed Nasheed]] and President [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan|Dr. Mohamed Waheed Hassan]], from 2008 to 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=DQP condemns TVM poll on religious freedom – Minivan News – Archive |url=https://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/dqp-condemns-tvm-poll-on-religious-freedom-1029 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=minivannewsarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 2012 to 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Political advisor Hassan Saeed meets UK Parliamentary Under Secretary of State – Minivan News – Archive |url=https://minivannewsarchive.com/news-in-brief/political-advisor-hassan-saeed-meets-uk-parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state-32527 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=minivannewsarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Over the years, Dr. Saeed was responsible for drafting some 24 Bills for government agencies and political parties (a detailed list can be found at [https://www.drsaeed.mv drsaeed.mv].

==Reforms==
As the Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives and as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and Juvenile Court in the Maldives, Dr. Saeed introduced many groundbreaking reforms that addressed and sought an end to a long history of human rights abuses and abuses of power in the Maldivian legal system.

=== '''Reforms as the Chief Judge''' ===
Dr. Saeed introduced several steps enhancing rights of defendants. These include access to legal representation, access to evidence, medical examinations at the court’s expense in case of alleged torture or physical violence, and barring handcuffed defendants (unless violent). 

On the administrative side, Dr. Saeed introduced sentencing guidelines, computerized the country’s 25-year-old criminal records, and created the first ever self-funded medica insurance scheme for the judges of his courts. 

Dr. Saeed’s appointment as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and the Juvenile Court at the height of the 25-year authoritarian rule of President Gayyoom, a period in which citizens lacked very basic human rights, 97% of convictions were based on confessions, judges were hired and fired at the will of the executive branch, and judges lacked mandates for such reform initiatives. In this historical context, Dr. Saeed’s reforms were unprecedented and substantial. 

=== '''Reforms as the Attorney General''' ===
Dr. Saeed used his position as the Attorney General of the country to revolutionize the protection of human rights and the enhancement of legal-political rights and institutional reforms. 

His formal legal opinion on citizens’ rights to form political parties paved the way for the first ever formation and registration of political parties with legislative and financial backing by the state. He also headed the establishment of the country’s first Human Rights Commission and provided a detailed legislative framework for it. Drawing from his postgraduate research, Dr. Saeed extended maximum protection for free speech by bringing an end to the criminal prosecution of reporters and editors by decriminalizing defamation, subsequently providing protection for whistleblowers.

On the criminal justice side, Dr. Saeed introduced the National Criminal Justice Reform Plan. The crown jewel of the Plan was the introduction of a modern Penal Code that is in accord with classic Islamic law and local customary practices while, by and large, complying with Western and international norms. 

In a series of phases, he also replaced the confession-based investigation, prosecution, and conviction system with that of an evidence-based system. These included access to legal counsel during investigation, audio-video recording of investigations, introduction of arrestable and non-arrestable offences, habeas corpus, a bail system, separation of police from military, and the establishment of police oversight mechanisms. He also opened the country’s prison systems to domestic and international human rights bodies such as Amnesty International, the Red Cross, the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives, and parliamentary and judiciary committees

In the judicial reform, Dr. Saeed spearheaded the establishment of the Judicial Service Commission for overseeing judges (as opposed to the President and the Justice Minister). He started a program to replace old untrained judges with Western-educated law graduates. He ensured the selection of an equal number of male and female students – which eventually became the catalyst for the appointment of the first ever female judges in the country against the outcry of conservative religious groups. 

Dr. Saeed also discarded the old rules requiring government written consent for citizens to bring legal action against the state in civil matters. 

Seeing widespread domestic and international support for the reforms Dr. Saeed was introducing, several cabinet ministers who had been working in the country’s dictatorial setup, jumped onto the reformist bandwagon. This led to parallel reforms in several other fronts. This reformist pandora’s box soon led to the defeat of the conservative elements in the government.

'''Dr. Hassan Saeed''' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. ޙަސަން ސަޢީދު) was the former [[Attorney General (Maldives)|Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives]], a role in which he served from November 11, 2003 to August 5, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Attorney General's Office |url=http://agoffice.gov.mv/#/Attorney%20General/Former%20Attorneys%20General |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=agoffice.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is the current managing partner of [http://chambersinn.com.mv Chambers Inn], a leading corporate law firm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://maldivesbarcouncil.org/ |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=Bar Council of the Maldives |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He is also the Managing Director of [https://www.property.mv Premier Property Pvt Ltd], the country’s leading real estate management, sales, and rental company. 

Prior to establishing his own law firm and his transition into the world of real estate and corporate law, Dr. Saeed led a long political and legal career in the government of the Republic of Maldives. In 1996, he served as a State Attorney, and after completing his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate in law]] at the [https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2003/05/uq-awards-honorary-doctorate-former-governor-general University of Queensland (Australia)] and serving as the Chief Judge of the [http://www.criminalcourt.gov.mv Criminal Court] and the [https://juvenilecourt.gov.mv Juvenile Court], was appointed to the position of [[Attorney General (Maldives)|Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives]] in 2003, a position in which he served until mid-2007. 

As the Attorney General, Dr. Saeed served as the chief legal advisor to the Maldivian government and led a long series of reforms to completely overhaul the island chain’s archaic politico-legal system and transform it into that of a functional liberal democracy. These reforms took much of their inspiration from the legal systems of modern Western democracies while maintaining a deep connection to Islamic law and local traditions. 

In June 2007, Dr. Saeed resigned&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2007-08-05 |title=Maldives officials quit, say president blocks reform |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-28831620070805 |access-date=2022-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the post of the Attorney General when he realized the government was not sincere in the reform process and was slowing and even trying to reverse the reform process.

He also served as an advisor to two different presidents, [[Mohamed Nasheed|President Mohamed Nasheed]] and President [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan|Dr. Mohamed Waheed Hassan]], from 2008 to 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=DQP condemns TVM poll on religious freedom – Minivan News – Archive |url=https://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/dqp-condemns-tvm-poll-on-religious-freedom-1029 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=minivannewsarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 2012 to 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Political advisor Hassan Saeed meets UK Parliamentary Under Secretary of State – Minivan News – Archive |url=https://minivannewsarchive.com/news-in-brief/political-advisor-hassan-saeed-meets-uk-parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state-32527 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=minivannewsarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Over the years, Dr. Saeed was responsible for drafting some 24 Bills for government agencies and political parties (a detailed list can be found at [https://www.drsaeed.mv drsaeed.mv].

After serving in the Maldivian government for many years, Dr. Saeed turned to the world of corporate law and real estate (management, sales, rental, and development).

==Education==
A recognized scholar and lifelong student, Dr. Saeed did not receive any kind of formal schooling. At the age of 10 he was enrolled in Jamiah Salafiyaa – a highly conservative [[Islamic Theology|Islamic theology]] ''madrasa'' in [[Pakistan]] where he studied classic [[Islamic studies]] for 7 years in [[Urdu]] and [[Arabic]] language.  In 1988 he joined a pre-university program at the [[International Islamic University Malaysia|Islamic University of Malaysia]], where he spent initial two years learning the [[English language|English]] language from scratch before embarking on his legal education. 

Dr. Saeed earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree from the [[University of Queensland]] in 2003, alongside a [[Master of Comparative Law]] from International Islamic University in 1997 and a [[Bachelor of Laws|Bachelor of Law with Honours]] from the same institution in 1995. 

Dr. Saeed’s masters and doctoral thesis focused on constitutional law with a particular emphasis on free speech.

Briefly he served as a Member of the Board of Governors of International Islamic University Malaysia. He served as the Vice-President of People Party (Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party) and later he founded and served as the President of the Maldives National Party (Dhivehi Qaumi Party)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=ގައުމީ ޕާޓީގެ ރައީސް ކަމަށް ޑރ. ހަސަން އަދި ނައިބު ރައީސް ކަމަށް ރިޔާޒު ވޯޓަކަށް ނުގޮސް އިންތިހާބުވެއްޖެ |url=https://sun.mv/576 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=sun.mv |language=dv}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Reforms==
As the Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives and as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and Juvenile Court in the Maldives, Dr. Saeed introduced many groundbreaking reforms that addressed and sought an end to a long history of human rights abuses and abuses of power in the Maldivian legal system.

=== '''Reforms as the Chief Judge''' ===
Dr. Saeed introduced several steps enhancing rights of defendants. These include access to legal representation, access to evidence, medical examinations at the court’s expense in case of alleged torture or physical violence, and barring handcuffed defendants (unless violent). 

On the administrative side, Dr. Saeed introduced sentencing guidelines, computerized the country’s 25-year-old criminal records, and created the first ever self-funded medica insurance scheme for the judges of his courts. 

Dr. Saeed’s appointment as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and the Juvenile Court at the height of the 25-year authoritarian rule of President Gayyoom, a period in which citizens lacked very basic human rights, 97% of convictions were based on confessions, judges were hired and fired at the will of the executive branch, and judges lacked mandates for such reform initiatives. In this historical context, Dr. Saeed’s reforms were unprecedented and substantial. 

=== '''Reforms as the Attorney General''' ===
Dr. Saeed used his position as the Attorney General of the country to revolutionize the protection of human rights and the enhancement of legal-political rights and institutional reforms. 

His formal legal opinion on citizens’ rights to form political parties paved the way for the first ever formation and registration of political parties with legislative and financial backing by the state. He also headed the establishment of the country’s first Human Rights Commission and provided a detailed legislative framework for it. Drawing from his postgraduate research, Dr. Saeed extended maximum protection for free speech by bringing an end to the criminal prosecution of reporters and editors by decriminalizing defamation, subsequently providing protection for whistleblowers.

On the criminal justice side, Dr. Saeed introduced the National Criminal Justice Reform Plan. The crown jewel of the Plan was the introduction of a modern Penal Code that is in accord with classic Islamic law and local customary practices while, by and large, complying with Western and international norms. 

In a series of phases, he also replaced the confession-based investigation, prosecution, and conviction system with that of an evidence-based system. These included access to legal counsel during investigation, audio-video recording of investigations, introduction of arrestable and non-arrestable offences, habeas corpus, a bail system, separation of police from military, and the establishment of police oversight mechanisms. He also opened the country’s prison systems to domestic and international human rights bodies such as Amnesty International, the Red Cross, the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives, and parliamentary and judiciary committees

In the judicial reform, Dr. Saeed spearheaded the establishment of the Judicial Service Commission for overseeing judges (as opposed to the President and the Justice Minister). He started a program to replace old untrained judges with Western-educated law graduates. He ensured the selection of an equal number of male and female students – which eventually became the catalyst for the appointment of the first ever female judges in the country against the outcry of conservative religious groups. 

Dr. Saeed also discarded the old rules requiring government written consent for citizens to bring legal action against the state in civil matters. 

Seeing widespread domestic and international support for the reforms Dr. Saeed was introducing, several cabinet ministers who had been working in the country’s dictatorial setup, jumped onto the reformist bandwagon. This led to parallel reforms in several other fronts. This reformist pandora’s box soon led to the defeat of the conservative elements in the government.

'''Dr. Hassan Saeed''' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. ޙަސަން ސަޢީދު) was the former [[Attorney General (Maldives)|Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives]], a role in which he served from November 11, 2003 to August 5, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Attorney General's Office |url=http://agoffice.gov.mv/#/Attorney%20General/Former%20Attorneys%20General |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=agoffice.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the current managing partner of [http://chambersinn.com.mv Chambers Inn], a leading corporate law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://maldivesbarcouncil.org/ |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=Bar Council of the Maldives |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the Managing Director of [https://www.property.mv Premier Property Pvt Ltd], the country’s leading real estate management, sales, and rental company. 

Prior to establishing his own law firm and his transition into the world of real estate and corporate law, Dr. Saeed led a long political and legal career in the government of the Republic of Maldives. In 1996, he served as a State Attorney, and after completing his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate in law]] at the [https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2003/05/uq-awards-honorary-doctorate-former-governor-general University of Queensland (Australia)] and serving as the Chief Judge of the [http://www.criminalcourt.gov.mv Criminal Court] and the [https://juvenilecourt.gov.mv Juvenile Court], was appointed to the position of [[Attorney General (Maldives)|Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives]] in 2003, a position in which he served until mid-2007. 

As the Attorney General, Dr. Saeed served as the chief legal advisor to the Maldivian government and led a long series of reforms to completely overhaul the island chain’s archaic politico-legal system and transform it into that of a functional liberal democracy. These reforms took much of their inspiration from the legal systems of modern Western democracies while maintaining a deep connection to Islamic law and local traditions. 

In June 2007, Dr. Saeed resigned&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2007-08-05 |title=Maldives officials quit, say president blocks reform |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-28831620070805 |access-date=2022-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the post of the Attorney General when he realized the government was not sincere in the reform process and was slowing and even trying to reverse the reform process.

'''Hassan Saeed''' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. ޙަސަން ސަޢީދު) was the former [[Attorney General (Maldives)|Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives]], a role in which he served from November 11, 2003 to August 5, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Attorney General's Office |url=http://agoffice.gov.mv/#/Attorney%20General/Former%20Attorneys%20General |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=agoffice.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the current managing partner of [http://chambersinn.com.mv Chambers Inn], a leading corporate law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://maldivesbarcouncil.org/ |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=Bar Council of the Maldives |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the Managing Director of [https://www.property.mv Premier Property Pvt Ltd], the country’s leading real estate management, sales, and rental company.

Prior to establishing his own law firm and his transition into the world of real estate and corporate law, Saeed led a long political and legal career in the government of the Republic of Maldives. In 1996, he served as a State Attorney, and after completing his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate in law]] at the [https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2003/05/uq-awards-honorary-doctorate-former-governor-general University of Queensland (Australia)] and serving as the Chief Judge of the [http://www.criminalcourt.gov.mv Criminal Court] and the [https://juvenilecourt.gov.mv Juvenile Court], was appointed to the position of [[Attorney General (Maldives)|Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives]] in 2003, a position in which he served until mid-2007.

As the Attorney General, Saeed served as the chief legal advisor to the Maldivian government and led a long series of reforms to completely overhaul the island chain’s archaic politico-legal system and transform it into that of a functional liberal democracy. These reforms took much of their inspiration from the legal systems of modern Western democracies while maintaining a deep connection to Islamic law and local traditions.

In June 2007, Saeed resigned&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2007-08-05 |title=Maldives officials quit, say president blocks reform |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-28831620070805 |access-date=2022-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the post of the Attorney General when he realized the government was not sincere in the reform process and was slowing and even trying to reverse the reform process.

In the country’s first ever independent and democratic election,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2008-10-08 |title=Maldives hold first multiparty presidential poll |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-35851720081008 |access-date=2022-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed contested as an independent candidate and came to the 3rd place&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Election Commission of Maldives |url=https://www.elections.gov.mv/en/ec/elections/presidentialelectionresults2008.html |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=www.elections.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; on an agenda based on reform and clean and transparent governance.

He also served as an advisor to two different presidents, [[Mohamed Nasheed|President Mohamed Nasheed]] and President [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan]], from 2008 to 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=DQP condemns TVM poll on religious freedom – Minivan News – Archive |url=https://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/dqp-condemns-tvm-poll-on-religious-freedom-1029 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=minivannewsarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 2012 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Political advisor Hassan Saeed meets UK Parliamentary Under Secretary of State – Minivan News – Archive |url=https://minivannewsarchive.com/news-in-brief/political-advisor-hassan-saeed-meets-uk-parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state-32527 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=minivannewsarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Saeed was responsible for drafting some 24 Bills for government agencies and political parties.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed list can be found at [https://www.drsaeed.mv drsaeed.mv]&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving in the Maldivian government for many years, Saeed turned to the world of corporate law and real estate (management, sales, rental, and development). Today, Saeed is the leading expert on real estate law and management in the country and has liaised with the country’s leading developers from the first ever condominium built in the country in 2009.

==Education==
A recognized scholar and lifelong student, Saeed did not receive any kind of formal schooling. At the age of 10 he was enrolled in Jamiah Salafiyaa – a highly conservative [[Islamic Theology|Islamic theology]] ''madrasa'' in [[Pakistan]] where he studied classic [[Islamic studies]] for 7 years in [[Urdu]] and [[Arabic]] language.  In 1988 he joined a pre-university program at the [[International Islamic University Malaysia|Islamic University of Malaysia]], where he spent initial two years learning the [[English language|English]] language from scratch before embarking on his legal education.

Saeed earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree from the [[University of Queensland]] in 2003, alongside a [[Master of Comparative Law]] from International Islamic University in 1997 and a [[Bachelor of Laws|Bachelor of Law with Honours]] from the same institution in 1995.

Saeed’s masters and doctoral thesis focused on constitutional law with a particular emphasis on free speech.

== Academic Life ==
He has lectured in law faculties at multiple respected international universities, including his alma mater, the University of Queensland. He is also an Islamic scholar that has written on liberal Islam, having co-authored a book on the subject entitled “Freedom of Religion, Apostasy, and Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam |url=https://www.routledge.com/Freedom-of-Religion-Apostasy-and-Islam/Saeed/p/book/9780754630838 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=Routledge &amp; CRC Press |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;” with [[Abdullah Saeed (professor)|Professor Abdullah Saeed]] of [[University of Melbourne]], and assisted Professor Keith Fletcher in updating “[https://www.thomsonreuters.co.nz/the-law-of-partnership-in-australia-9th-edition/productdetail/122029 Partnership Law in Australia and New Zealand]” – a leading textbook on the subject. He also authored a number of books and reports on the Maldives rights and democracy, some of which include “''[https://books.google.mv/books/about/Democracy_Betrayed.html?id=_OVplAEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Democracy Betrayed Behind the Mask of The Island President]”; “Lies, Misleading and Untold Truth”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Government Condemns Opposition Party's &quot;Pamphlet of Hate&quot; |url=https://presidency.gov.mv/Press/Article/6605 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=The President's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;'';'' and “''Male International Airport Long-term Lease to GMR Company – Challenges and Losses thereof”.''

He also was a partner in a project for the introduction of Islamic Law at the University of Queensland – a subject which he went on to teach as well. He assisted in designing course outlines for “The Methodology of Islamic Law” – a postgraduate course, for University of Melbourne, Australia.

Today Saeed owns and operates (free-of-charge) the country’s largest and most comprehensive legal database &quot;[https://gaanoon.com www.gaanoon.com]&quot;– a project on which he has spent personal time and money since its inception in 2012. As part of the project Saeed has, for the first time in the country’s history, provided the following:

# All laws, regulations, decrees, and bylaws from a single source.
# The most authoritative and comprehensive legal dictionary.
# Consolidated all the laws.

== Membership/Professional Qualification ==
Saeed is a registered [[Barrister|Barrister-at-Law]] in the [[High Court of Australia]] and a registered [[Solicitor|Advocator and Solicitor]] in the [[Supreme Court of the Maldives|Supreme Court of Maldives]]. He served as a member of the Maldives Constitutional Assembly, Chairman of the National Law Commission and Member of the Judicial Service Commission. Briefly he served as a Member of the Board of Governors of International Islamic University Malaysia. He served as the Vice-President of People Party (Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party) and later he founded and served as the President of the Maldives National Party (Dhivehi Qaumi Party).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=ގައުމީ ޕާޓީގެ ރައީސް ކަމަށް ޑރ. ހަސަން އަދި ނައިބު ރައީސް ކަމަށް ރިޔާޒު ވޯޓަކަށް ނުގޮސް އިންތިހާބުވެއްޖެ |url=https://sun.mv/576 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=sun.mv |language=dv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==
As the Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives and as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and Juvenile Court in the Maldives, Saeed introduced many groundbreaking reforms that addressed and sought an end to a long history of human rights abuses and abuses of power in the Maldivian legal system.

=== Reforms as the Chief Judge ===
Saeed introduced several steps enhancing rights of defendants. These include access to legal representation, access to evidence, medical examinations at the court’s expense in case of alleged torture or physical violence, and barring handcuffed defendants (unless violent).

On the administrative side, Saeed introduced sentencing guidelines, computerized the country’s 25-year-old criminal records, and created the first ever self-funded medica insurance scheme for the judges of his courts.

Saeed’s appointment as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and the Juvenile Court at the height of the 25-year authoritarian rule of President Gayyoom, a period in which citizens lacked very basic human rights, 97% of convictions were based on confessions, judges were hired and fired at the will of the executive branch, and judges lacked mandates for such reform initiatives. In this historical context, Saeed’s reforms were unprecedented and substantial.

=== Reforms as the Attorney General ===
Saeed used his position as the Attorney General of the country to revolutionize the protection of human rights and the enhancement of legal-political rights and institutional reforms.

His formal legal opinion on citizens’ rights to form political parties paved the way for the first ever formation and registration of political parties with legislative and financial backing by the state. He also headed the establishment of the country’s first Human Rights Commission and provided a detailed legislative framework for it. Drawing from his postgraduate research, Saeed extended maximum protection for free speech by bringing an end to the criminal prosecution of reporters and editors by decriminalizing defamation, subsequently providing protection for whistleblowers.

On the criminal justice side, Saeed introduced the National Criminal Justice Reform Plan. The crown jewel of the Plan was the introduction of a modern Penal Code that is in accord with classic Islamic law and local customary practices while, by and large, complying with Western and international norms.

In a series of phases, he also replaced the confession-based investigation, prosecution, and conviction system with that of an evidence-based system. These included access to legal counsel during investigation, audio-video recording of investigations, introduction of arrestable and non-arrestable offences, habeas corpus, a bail system, separation of police from military, and the establishment of police oversight mechanisms. He also opened the country’s prison systems to domestic and international human rights bodies such as Amnesty International, the Red Cross, the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives, and parliamentary and judiciary committees

In the judicial reform, Saeed spearheaded the establishment of the Judicial Service Commission for overseeing judges (as opposed to the President and the Justice Minister). He started a program to replace old untrained judges with Western-educated law graduates. He ensured the selection of an equal number of male and female students – which eventually became the catalyst for the appointment of the first ever female judges in the country against the outcry of conservative religious groups.

Saeed also discarded the old rules requiring government written consent for citizens to bring legal action against the state in civil matters.

Seeing widespread domestic and international support for the reforms Saeed was introducing, several cabinet ministers who had been working in the country’s dictatorial setup, jumped onto the reformist bandwagon. This led to parallel reforms in several other fronts. This reformist pandora’s box soon led to the defeat of the conservative elements in the government.

==Education==
A recognized scholar and lifelong student, Saeed did not receive any kind of formal schooling. At the age of 10 he was enrolled in Jamiah Salafiyaa – a highly conservative [[Islamic Theology|Islamic theology]] ''madrasa'' in [[Pakistan]] where he studied classic [[Islamic studies]] for 7 years in [[Urdu]] and [[Arabic]] language.  In 1988 he joined a pre-university program at the [[International Islamic University Malaysia|Islamic University of Malaysia]], where he spent initial two years learning the [[English language|English]] language from scratch before embarking on his legal education.

Saeed earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree from the [[University of Queensland]] in 2003, alongside a [[Master of Comparative Law]] from International Islamic University in 1997 and a [[Bachelor of Laws|Bachelor of Law with Honours]] from the same institution in 1995.

Saeed’s masters and doctoral thesis focused on constitutional law with a particular emphasis on free speech.

== Academic Life ==
He has lectured in law faculties at multiple respected international universities, including his alma mater, the University of Queensland. He is also an Islamic scholar that has written on liberal Islam, having co-authored a book on the subject entitled “Freedom of Religion, Apostasy, and Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam |url=https://www.routledge.com/Freedom-of-Religion-Apostasy-and-Islam/Saeed/p/book/9780754630838 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=Routledge &amp; CRC Press |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;” with [[Abdullah Saeed (professor)|Professor Abdullah Saeed]] of [[University of Melbourne]], and assisted Professor Keith Fletcher in updating “[https://www.thomsonreuters.co.nz/the-law-of-partnership-in-australia-9th-edition/productdetail/122029 Partnership Law in Australia and New Zealand]” – a leading textbook on the subject. He also authored a number of books and reports on the Maldives rights and democracy, some of which include “''[https://books.google.mv/books/about/Democracy_Betrayed.html?id=_OVplAEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Democracy Betrayed Behind the Mask of The Island President]”; “Lies, Misleading and Untold Truth”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Government Condemns Opposition Party's &quot;Pamphlet of Hate&quot; |url=https://presidency.gov.mv/Press/Article/6605 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=The President's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;'';'' and “''Male International Airport Long-term Lease to GMR Company – Challenges and Losses thereof”.''

He also was a partner in a project for the introduction of Islamic Law at the University of Queensland – a subject which he went on to teach as well. He assisted in designing course outlines for “The Methodology of Islamic Law” – a postgraduate course, for University of Melbourne, Australia.

Today Saeed owns and operates (free-of-charge) the country’s largest and most comprehensive legal database &quot;[https://gaanoon.com www.gaanoon.com]&quot;– a project on which he has spent personal time and money since its inception in 2012. As part of the project Saeed has, for the first time in the country’s history, provided the following:

# All laws, regulations, decrees, and bylaws from a single source.
# The most authoritative and comprehensive legal dictionary.
# Consolidated all the laws.

== Membership/Professional Qualification ==
Saeed is a registered [[Barrister|Barrister-at-Law]] in the [[High Court of Australia]] and a registered [[Solicitor|Advocator and Solicitor]] in the [[Supreme Court of the Maldives|Supreme Court of Maldives]]. He served as a member of the Maldives Constitutional Assembly, Chairman of the National Law Commission and Member of the Judicial Service Commission. Briefly he served as a Member of the Board of Governors of International Islamic University Malaysia. He served as the Vice-President of People Party (Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party) and later he founded and served as the President of the Maldives National Party (Dhivehi Qaumi Party).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=ގައުމީ ޕާޓީގެ ރައީސް ކަމަށް ޑރ. ހަސަން އަދި ނައިބު ރައީސް ކަމަށް ރިޔާޒު ވޯޓަކަށް ނުގޮސް އިންތިހާބުވެއްޖެ |url=https://sun.mv/576 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=sun.mv |language=dv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==
As the Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives and as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and Juvenile Court in the Maldives, Saeed introduced many groundbreaking reforms that addressed and sought an end to a long history of human rights abuses and abuses of power in the Maldivian legal system.

=== Reforms as the Chief Judge ===
Saeed introduced several steps enhancing rights of defendants. These include access to legal representation, access to evidence, medical examinations at the court’s expense in case of alleged torture or physical violence, and barring handcuffed defendants (unless violent).

On the administrative side, Saeed introduced sentencing guidelines, computerized the country’s 25-year-old criminal records, and created the first ever self-funded medica insurance scheme for the judges of his courts.

Saeed’s appointment as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and the Juvenile Court at the height of the 25-year authoritarian rule of President Gayyoom, a period in which citizens lacked very basic human rights, 97% of convictions were based on confessions, judges were hired and fired at the will of the executive branch, and judges lacked mandates for such reform initiatives. In this historical context, Saeed’s reforms were unprecedented and substantial.

=== Reforms as the Attorney General ===
Saeed used his position as the Attorney General of the country to revolutionize the protection of human rights and the enhancement of legal-political rights and institutional reforms.

His formal legal opinion on citizens’ rights to form political parties paved the way for the first ever formation and registration of political parties with legislative and financial backing by the state. He also headed the establishment of the country’s first Human Rights Commission and provided a detailed legislative framework for it. Drawing from his postgraduate research, Saeed extended maximum protection for free speech by bringing an end to the criminal prosecution of reporters and editors by decriminalizing defamation, subsequently providing protection for whistleblowers.

On the criminal justice side, Saeed introduced the National Criminal Justice Reform Plan. The crown jewel of the Plan was the introduction of a modern Penal Code that is in accord with classic Islamic law and local customary practices while, by and large, complying with Western and international norms.

In a series of phases, he also replaced the confession-based investigation, prosecution, and conviction system with that of an evidence-based system. These included access to legal counsel during investigation, audio-video recording of investigations, introduction of arrestable and non-arrestable offences, habeas corpus, a bail system, separation of police from military, and the establishment of police oversight mechanisms. He also opened the country’s prison systems to domestic and international human rights bodies such as Amnesty International, the Red Cross, the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives, and parliamentary and judiciary committees

In the judicial reform, Saeed spearheaded the establishment of the Judicial Service Commission for overseeing judges (as opposed to the President and the Justice Minister). He started a program to replace old untrained judges with Western-educated law graduates. He ensured the selection of an equal number of male and female students – which eventually became the catalyst for the appointment of the first ever female judges in the country against the outcry of conservative religious groups.

Saeed also discarded the old rules requiring government written consent for citizens to bring legal action against the state in civil matters.

Seeing widespread domestic and international support for the reforms Saeed was introducing, several cabinet ministers who had been working in the country’s dictatorial setup, jumped onto the reformist bandwagon. This led to parallel reforms in several other fronts. This reformist pandora’s box soon led to the defeat of the conservative elements in the government.

In 1996, he served as a State Attorney, and after completing his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate in law]] at [[University of Queensland|the University of Queensland]] and serving as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and the Juvenile Court, was appointed to the position of [[Attorney General (Maldives)|Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives]] in 2003, a position in which he served until mid-2007.

As the Attorney General, Saeed served as the chief legal advisor to the [[Maldivian government]] and led a long series of reforms to completely overhaul the country's politico-legal system and transform it into that of a functional liberal democracy.{{Cn|date=January 2023}} These reforms took much of their inspiration from the legal systems of modern Western democracies while maintaining a deep connection to Islamic law and local traditions.

Today, Saeed an expert on Maldivian real estate law and management and has liaised with the country’s leading developers from the first ever condominium built in the country in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023|reason=Expert claim}}

==Education==
A recognized scholar and lifelong student, Saeed did not receive any kind of formal schooling. At the age of 10 he was enrolled in Jamiah Salafiyaa – a highly conservative [[Islamic Theology|Islamic theology]] ''madrasa'' in [[Pakistan]] where he studied classic [[Islamic studies]] for 7 years in [[Urdu]] and [[Arabic]] language.  In 1988 he joined a pre-university program at the [[International Islamic University Malaysia|Islamic University of Malaysia]], where he spent initial two years learning the [[English language|English]] language from scratch before embarking on his legal education.

Saeed earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree from the [[University of Queensland]] in 2003, alongside a [[Master of Comparative Law]] from International Islamic University in 1997 and a [[Bachelor of Laws|Bachelor of Law with Honours]] from the same institution in 1995.

Saeed’s masters and doctoral thesis focused on constitutional law with a particular emphasis on free speech.

== Academic Life ==
He has lectured in law faculties at multiple respected international universities, including his alma mater, the University of Queensland. He is also an Islamic scholar that has written on liberal Islam, having co-authored a book on the subject entitled “Freedom of Religion, Apostasy, and Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam |url=https://www.routledge.com/Freedom-of-Religion-Apostasy-and-Islam/Saeed/p/book/9780754630838 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=Routledge &amp; CRC Press |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;” with [[Abdullah Saeed (professor)|Professor Abdullah Saeed]] of [[University of Melbourne]], and assisted Professor Keith Fletcher in updating “[https://www.thomsonreuters.co.nz/the-law-of-partnership-in-australia-9th-edition/productdetail/122029 Partnership Law in Australia and New Zealand]” – a leading textbook on the subject. He also authored a number of books and reports on the Maldives rights and democracy, some of which include “''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_OVplAEACAAJ Democracy Betrayed Behind the Mask of The Island President]”; “Lies, Misleading and Untold Truth”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Government Condemns Opposition Party's &quot;Pamphlet of Hate&quot; |url=https://presidency.gov.mv/Press/Article/6605 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=The President's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;'';'' and “''Male International Airport Long-term Lease to GMR Company – Challenges and Losses thereof”.''

He also was a partner in a project for the introduction of Islamic Law at the University of Queensland – a subject which he went on to teach as well. He assisted in designing course outlines for “The Methodology of Islamic Law” – a postgraduate course, for University of Melbourne, Australia.

Today Saeed owns and operates (free-of-charge) the country’s largest and most comprehensive legal database &quot;[https://gaanoon.com www.gaanoon.com]&quot;– a project on which he has spent personal time and money since its inception in 2012. As part of the project Saeed has, for the first time in the country’s history, provided the following:

# All laws, regulations, decrees, and bylaws from a single source.
# The most authoritative and comprehensive legal dictionary.
# Consolidated all the laws.

== Membership/Professional Qualification ==
Saeed is a registered [[Barrister|Barrister-at-Law]] in the [[High Court of Australia]] and a registered [[Solicitor|Advocator and Solicitor]] in the [[Supreme Court of the Maldives|Supreme Court of Maldives]]. He served as a member of the Maldives Constitutional Assembly, Chairman of the National Law Commission and Member of the Judicial Service Commission. Briefly he served as a Member of the Board of Governors of International Islamic University Malaysia. He served as the Vice-President of People Party (Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party) and later he founded and served as the President of the Maldives National Party (Dhivehi Qaumi Party).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=ގައުމީ ޕާޓީގެ ރައީސް ކަމަށް ޑރ. ހަސަން އަދި ނައިބު ރައީސް ކަމަށް ރިޔާޒު ވޯޓަކަށް ނުގޮސް އިންތިހާބުވެއްޖެ |url=https://sun.mv/576 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=sun.mv |language=dv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==
As the Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives and as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and Juvenile Court in the Maldives, Saeed introduced many groundbreaking reforms that addressed and sought an end to a long history of human rights abuses and abuses of power in the Maldivian legal system.

=== Reforms as the Chief Judge ===
Saeed introduced several steps enhancing rights of defendants. These include access to legal representation, access to evidence, medical examinations at the court’s expense in case of alleged torture or physical violence, and barring handcuffed defendants (unless violent).

On the administrative side, Saeed introduced sentencing guidelines, computerized the country’s 25-year-old criminal records, and created the first ever self-funded medica insurance scheme for the judges of his courts.

Saeed’s appointment as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and the Juvenile Court at the height of the 25-year authoritarian rule of President Gayyoom, a period in which citizens lacked very basic human rights, 97% of convictions were based on confessions, judges were hired and fired at the will of the executive branch, and judges lacked mandates for such reform initiatives. In this historical context, Saeed’s reforms were unprecedented and substantial.

=== Reforms as the Attorney General ===
Saeed used his position as the Attorney General of the country to revolutionize the protection of human rights and the enhancement of legal-political rights and institutional reforms.

His formal legal opinion on citizens’ rights to form political parties paved the way for the first ever formation and registration of political parties with legislative and financial backing by the state. He also headed the establishment of the country’s first Human Rights Commission and provided a detailed legislative framework for it. Drawing from his postgraduate research, Saeed extended maximum protection for free speech by bringing an end to the criminal prosecution of reporters and editors by decriminalizing defamation, subsequently providing protection for whistleblowers.

On the criminal justice side, Saeed introduced the National Criminal Justice Reform Plan. The crown jewel of the Plan was the introduction of a modern Penal Code that is in accord with classic Islamic law and local customary practices while, by and large, complying with Western and international norms.

In a series of phases, he also replaced the confession-based investigation, prosecution, and conviction system with that of an evidence-based system. These included access to legal counsel during investigation, audio-video recording of investigations, introduction of arrestable and non-arrestable offences, habeas corpus, a bail system, separation of police from military, and the establishment of police oversight mechanisms. He also opened the country’s prison systems to domestic and international human rights bodies such as Amnesty International, the Red Cross, the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives, and parliamentary and judiciary committees

In the judicial reform, Saeed spearheaded the establishment of the Judicial Service Commission for overseeing judges (as opposed to the President and the Justice Minister). He started a program to replace old untrained judges with Western-educated law graduates. He ensured the selection of an equal number of male and female students – which eventually became the catalyst for the appointment of the first ever female judges in the country against the outcry of conservative religious groups.

Saeed also discarded the old rules requiring government written consent for citizens to bring legal action against the state in civil matters.

Seeing widespread domestic and international support for the reforms Saeed was introducing, several cabinet ministers who had been working in the country’s dictatorial setup, jumped onto the reformist bandwagon. This led to parallel reforms in several other fronts. This reformist pandora’s box soon led to the defeat of the conservative elements in the government.

'''Hassan Saeed''' ([[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]]: ޑރ. ޙަސަން ސަޢީދު) was the former [[Attorney General (Maldives)|Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives]], a role in which he served from November 11, 2003 to August 5, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Attorney General's Office |url=http://agoffice.gov.mv/#/Attorney%20General/Former%20Attorneys%20General |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=agoffice.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the current managing partner of Chambers Inn &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://maldivesbarcouncil.org/ |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=Bar Council of the Maldives |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the Managing Director of Premier Property Pvt Ltd.


Prior to establishing his own law firm and his transition into the world of real estate and corporate law, Saeed led a long political and legal career in the government of the Republic of Maldives. In 1996, he served as a State Attorney, and after completing his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate in law]] at [[University of Queensland|the University of Queensland]] and serving as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and the Juvenile Court, was appointed to the position of [[Attorney General (Maldives)|Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives]] in 2003, a position in which he served until mid-2007.

As the Attorney General, Saeed served as the chief legal advisor to the [[Maldivian government]] and led a long series of reforms to completely overhaul the country's politico-legal system and transform it into that of a functional liberal democracy.{{Cn|date=January 2023}} These reforms took much of their inspiration from the legal systems of modern Western democracies while maintaining a deep connection to Islamic law and local traditions.

In June 2007, Saeed resigned&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2007-08-05 |title=Maldives officials quit, say president blocks reform |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-28831620070805 |access-date=2022-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the post of the Attorney General, arguing that the government was not sincere in the reform process and was slowing and even trying to reverse the reform process.

He also served as an advisor to two different presidents: [[Mohamed Nasheed|President Mohamed Nasheed]], from 2008 to 2009, and President [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan]] from 2012 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Political advisor Hassan Saeed meets UK Parliamentary Under Secretary of State – Minivan News – Archive |url=https://minivannewsarchive.com/news-in-brief/political-advisor-hassan-saeed-meets-uk-parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state-32527 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=minivannewsarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Saeed was responsible for drafting some 24 Bills for government agencies and political parties.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed list can be found at [https://www.drsaeed.mv drsaeed.mv]&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving in the Maldivian government for many years, Saeed turned to the world of corporate law and real estate (management, sales, rental, and development). Today, Saeed an expert on Maldivian real estate law and management and has liaised with the country’s leading developers from the first ever condominium built in the country in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023|reason=Expert claim}}

==Education==
A recognized scholar and lifelong student, Saeed did not receive any kind of formal schooling. At the age of 10 he was enrolled in Jamiah Salafiyaa – a highly conservative [[Islamic Theology|Islamic theology]] ''madrasa'' in [[Pakistan]] where he studied classic [[Islamic studies]] for 7 years in [[Urdu]] and [[Arabic]] language.  In 1988 he joined a pre-university program at the [[International Islamic University Malaysia|Islamic University of Malaysia]], where he spent initial two years learning the [[English language|English]] language from scratch before embarking on his legal education.

Saeed earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree from the [[University of Queensland]] in 2003, alongside a [[Master of Comparative Law]] from International Islamic University in 1997 and a [[Bachelor of Laws|Bachelor of Law with Honours]] from the same institution in 1995.

Saeed’s masters and doctoral thesis focused on constitutional law with a particular emphasis on free speech.

== Academic Life ==
He has lectured in law faculties at multiple respected international universities, including his alma mater, the University of Queensland. He is also an Islamic scholar that has written on liberal Islam, having co-authored a book on the subject entitled “Freedom of Religion, Apostasy, and Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam |url=https://www.routledge.com/Freedom-of-Religion-Apostasy-and-Islam/Saeed/p/book/9780754630838 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=Routledge &amp; CRC Press |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;” with [[Abdullah Saeed (professor)|Professor Abdullah Saeed]] of [[University of Melbourne]], and assisted Professor Keith Fletcher in updating “[https://www.thomsonreuters.co.nz/the-law-of-partnership-in-australia-9th-edition/productdetail/122029 Partnership Law in Australia and New Zealand]” – a leading textbook on the subject. He also authored a number of books and reports on the Maldives rights and democracy, some of which include “''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_OVplAEACAAJ Democracy Betrayed Behind the Mask of The Island President]”; “Lies, Misleading and Untold Truth”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Government Condemns Opposition Party's &quot;Pamphlet of Hate&quot; |url=https://presidency.gov.mv/Press/Article/6605 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=The President's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;'';'' and “''Male International Airport Long-term Lease to GMR Company – Challenges and Losses thereof”.''

He also was a partner in a project for the introduction of Islamic Law at the University of Queensland – a subject which he went on to teach as well. He assisted in designing course outlines for “The Methodology of Islamic Law” – a postgraduate course, for University of Melbourne, Australia.

Today Saeed owns and operates (free-of-charge) the country’s largest and most comprehensive legal database &quot;[https://gaanoon.com www.gaanoon.com]&quot;– a project on which he has spent personal time and money since its inception in 2012. As part of the project Saeed has, for the first time in the country’s history, provided the following:

# All laws, regulations, decrees, and bylaws from a single source.
# The most authoritative and comprehensive legal dictionary.
# Consolidated all the laws.

== Membership/Professional Qualification ==
Saeed is a registered [[Barrister|Barrister-at-Law]] in the [[High Court of Australia]] and a registered [[Solicitor|Advocator and Solicitor]] in the [[Supreme Court of the Maldives|Supreme Court of Maldives]]. He served as a member of the Maldives Constitutional Assembly, Chairman of the National Law Commission and Member of the Judicial Service Commission. Briefly he served as a Member of the Board of Governors of International Islamic University Malaysia. He served as the Vice-President of People Party (Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party) and later he founded and served as the President of the Maldives National Party (Dhivehi Qaumi Party).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=ގައުމީ ޕާޓީގެ ރައީސް ކަމަށް ޑރ. ހަސަން އަދި ނައިބު ރައީސް ކަމަށް ރިޔާޒު ވޯޓަކަށް ނުގޮސް އިންތިހާބުވެއްޖެ |url=https://sun.mv/576 |access-date=2022-05-31 |website=sun.mv |language=dv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==
As the Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives and as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and Juvenile Court in the Maldives, Saeed introduced many groundbreaking reforms that addressed and sought an end to a long history of human rights abuses and abuses of power in the Maldivian legal system.

=== Reforms as the Chief Judge ===
Saeed introduced several steps enhancing rights of defendants. These include access to legal representation, access to evidence, medical examinations at the court’s expense in case of alleged torture or physical violence, and barring handcuffed defendants (unless violent).

On the administrative side, Saeed introduced sentencing guidelines, computerized the country’s 25-year-old criminal records, and created the first ever self-funded medica insurance scheme for the judges of his courts.

Saeed’s appointment as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and the Juvenile Court at the height of the 25-year authoritarian rule of President Gayyoom, a period in which citizens lacked very basic human rights, 97% of convictions were based on confessions, judges were hired and fired at the will of the executive branch, and judges lacked mandates for such reform initiatives. In this historical context, Saeed’s reforms were unprecedented and substantial.

=== Reforms as the Attorney General ===
Saeed used his position as the Attorney General of the country to revolutionize the protection of human rights and the enhancement of legal-political rights and institutional reforms.

His formal legal opinion on citizens’ rights to form political parties paved the way for the first ever formation and registration of political parties with legislative and financial backing by the state. He also headed the establishment of the country’s first Human Rights Commission and provided a detailed legislative framework for it. Drawing from his postgraduate research, Saeed extended maximum protection for free speech by bringing an end to the criminal prosecution of reporters and editors by decriminalizing defamation, subsequently providing protection for whistleblowers.

On the criminal justice side, Saeed introduced the National Criminal Justice Reform Plan. The crown jewel of the Plan was the introduction of a modern Penal Code that is in accord with classic Islamic law and local customary practices while, by and large, complying with Western and international norms.

In a series of phases, he also replaced the confession-based investigation, prosecution, and conviction system with that of an evidence-based system. These included access to legal counsel during investigation, audio-video recording of investigations, introduction of arrestable and non-arrestable offences, habeas corpus, a bail system, separation of police from military, and the establishment of police oversight mechanisms. He also opened the country’s prison systems to domestic and international human rights bodies such as Amnesty International, the Red Cross, the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives, and parliamentary and judiciary committees

In the judicial reform, Saeed spearheaded the establishment of the Judicial Service Commission for overseeing judges (as opposed to the President and the Justice Minister). He started a program to replace old untrained judges with Western-educated law graduates. He ensured the selection of an equal number of male and female students – which eventually became the catalyst for the appointment of the first ever female judges in the country against the outcry of conservative religious groups.

Saeed also discarded the old rules requiring government written consent for citizens to bring legal action against the state in civil matters.

Seeing widespread domestic and international support for the reforms Saeed was introducing, several cabinet ministers who had been working in the country’s dictatorial setup, jumped onto the reformist bandwagon. This led to parallel reforms in several other fronts. This reformist pandora’s box soon led to the defeat of the conservative elements in the government.

Prior to establishing his own law firm and entering real estate, Saeed served as a State Attorney, and after completing his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate in law]] at [[University of Queensland|the University of Queensland]] and serving as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and the Juvenile Court, was appointed to the position of [[Attorney General (Maldives)|Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives]].

As the Attorney General, Saeed served as the chief legal advisor to the [[Maldivian government]] and led a long series of reforms to overhaul and transform the country into a functional liberal democracy.{{Cn|date=January 2023}} These reforms took inspiration from the legal systems of modern Western democracies while maintaining local and Islamic distinctives.

In June 2007, Saeed resigned in protest,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2007-08-05 |title=Maldives officials quit, say president blocks reform |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-28831620070805 |access-date=2022-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the government was not sincere in the process and was slowing and even trying to reverse the reforms.

In the country’s first ever multiparty democratic election,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2008-10-08 |title=Maldives hold first multiparty presidential poll |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-35851720081008 |access-date=2022-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed contested as an independent candidate and came third on an agenda of clean, transparent governance and reform.

==Reforms==
As the Attorney General of the Republic of Maldives and as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and Juvenile Court in the Maldives, Saeed introduced reforms that addressed human rights abuses and abuses of power.

=== Reforms as the Chief Judge ===
Saeed introduced measures to enhance the rights of defendants. These included access to legal representation, access to evidence, medical examinations at the court’s expense in case of alleged torture or physical violence and barring handcuffed defendants (unless violent). He introduced sentencing guidelines, computerized the country’s 25-year-old criminal records, and created the first ever self-funded medical insurance scheme for judges.

Saeed’s appointment as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court and the Juvenile Court came at the height of the 25-year authoritarian rule of President Gayyoom. This was a period in which citizens lacked very basic human rights, 97% of convictions were based on confessions, judges were hired and fired at the will of the executive branch, and judges lacked mandates for such reform initiatives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2023|reason=Detailed yet sweeping claims}} Against this, Saeed’s reforms were substantial.

=== Reforms as the Attorney General ===
Saeed used his position as the Attorney General to advance human rights and the enhance political rights.

His formal legal opinion on citizens’ rights to form political parties paved the way for the first registration of political parties with state recognition and funding. He also headed the establishment of the first Human Rights Commission and provided its legislative framework. Saeed extended maximum protection for free speech by ending the criminal prosecution of reporters and editors and decriminalizing defamation and adding protections for whistleblowers.

Saeed introduced the National Criminal Justice Reform Plan. The Plan introduced a modern Penal Code in accord with classic Islamic law and local custom while, to some extent, complying with Western and international norms.

He also replaced the confession-based investigation, prosecution, and conviction system with that of an evidence-based system. These included access to legal counsel during investigation, audio-video recording of investigations, introduction of arrestable and non-arrestable offences, habeas corpus, a bail system, separation of police from military, and the establishment of police oversight mechanisms. He also opened the country’s prison systems to domestic and international human rights bodies such as Amnesty International, the Red Cross, the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives, and parliamentary and judiciary committees.

Saeed spearheaded the establishment of the Judicial Service Commission (as opposed to the President and the Justice Minister) to oversee judges. He started a program to replace old untrained judges with Western-educated law graduates. He ensured the selection of an equal number of male and female students, which catalyzed the appointment of the first female judges in the country, against the outcry of conservative religious groups.

Saeed also discarded the old rules requiring government written consent for citizens to bring legal action against the state in civil matters.

Seeing widespread domestic and international support for the reforms Saeed was introducing, several cabinet ministers who had been working in the country’s dictatorial setup, jumped onto the reformist bandwagon. This led to parallel reforms in several other fronts. This soon led to the defeat of the conservative elements in the government.
