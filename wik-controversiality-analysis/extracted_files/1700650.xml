'''Ahmed S. I. Moosa''' (&amp;#1927;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1962;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1931;&amp;#1968;  &amp;#1929;&amp;#1963;&amp;#1936;&amp;#1959;) ([[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian government and the president [[Maumoon Abdul   Gayoom]]. Mr. Moosa is currently living in exile in [[United Kingdom]] with his wife and 5   children.


==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whome  he had three sons; Adam, Micheal and Daniel. In [[2002]] they had an amicable [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whome he had son Alexander and daughter Enya  Angel.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled serveral government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.


==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondary education at [[Male' English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  aquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] aquring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.


==Political carrer==
[[Image:Sappeonbbc.jpg|thumb|200px|Ahmed MoosaSappé on [[BBC]] World Asia Today program, [[June 10]],  [[2004]]]]
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severly  beatun up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a civil unrest in the capital  city of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October  15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]] where he completed his [[Masters]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believe he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after it's  official announcement and currently is a member of it's general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian govermnet and was  usually responded.

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''' (&amp;#1927;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1931;&amp;#1962; &amp;#1949;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1930;&amp;#1961;&amp;#1934;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1927;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1924;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1923;&amp;#1959;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1929;&amp;#1963;&amp;#1936;&amp;#1959;) ([[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian government and the president [[Maumoon Abdul   Gayoom]]. Mr. Moosa is currently living in exile in [[United Kingdom]] with his wife and 5   children.


==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons; Adam, Micheal and Daniel. In [[2002]] they had an amicable [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had son Alexander and daughter Enya  Angel.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.


==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondary education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political carrer==
[[Image:Sappeonbbc.jpg|thumb|200px|Ahmed Moosa on [[BBC]] World Asia Today program, [[June 10]],  [[2004]]]]
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a civil unrest in the capital  city of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October  15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after it's  official announcement and currently is a member of it's general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''' (&amp;#1927;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1931;&amp;#1962; &amp;#1949;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1930;&amp;#1961;&amp;#1934;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1927;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1924;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1923;&amp;#1959;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1929;&amp;#1963;&amp;#1936;&amp;#1959;) ([[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian government and the president [[Maumoon Abdul   Gayoom]]. Mr. Moosa is currently living in exile in [[United Kingdom]] with his wife and 5   children.


==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons. In [[2002]] they had an amicable [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondary education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political carrer==
[[Image:Sappeonbbc.jpg|thumb|200px|Ahmed Moosa on [[BBC]] World Asia Today program, [[June 10]],  [[2004]]]]
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a civil unrest in the capital  city of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October  15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after it's  official announcement and currently is a member of it's general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''' (&amp;#1927;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1931;&amp;#1962; &amp;#1949;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1930;&amp;#1961;&amp;#1934;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1927;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1924;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1923;&amp;#1959;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1929;&amp;#1963;&amp;#1936;&amp;#1959;) ([[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian government and the president [[Maumoon Abdul   Gayoom]]. Mr. Moosa is currently living in self proclaimed exile in [[United Kingdom]] with his wife and 5   children.


==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons. In [[2002]] they had an amicable [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondary education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political carrer==
[[Image:Sappeonbbc.jpg|thumb|200px|Ahmed Moosa on [[BBC]] World Asia Today program, [[June 10]],  [[2004]]]]
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a civil unrest in the capital  city of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October  15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after it's  official announcement and currently is a member of it's general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''' (&amp;#1927;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1931;&amp;#1962; &amp;#1949;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1930;&amp;#1961;&amp;#1934;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1927;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1924;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1923;&amp;#1959;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1929;&amp;#1963;&amp;#1936;&amp;#1959;) ([[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian government and the president [[Maumoon Abdul   Gayoom]]. Mr. Moosa is currently living in self proclaimed exile in [[United Kingdom]] with his wife and 5   children.


==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons. In [[2002]] they had an amicable [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondary education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political carrer==
[[Image:Sappeonbbc.jpg|thumb|200px|Ahmed Moosa on [[BBC]] World Asia Today program, [[June 10]],  [[2004]]]]
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a civil unrest in the capital  city of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October  15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after it's  official announcement and currently is a member of it's general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website Dhivehi Observer,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''' (&amp;#1927;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1931;&amp;#1962; &amp;#1949;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1930;&amp;#1961;&amp;#1934;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1927;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1924;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1923;&amp;#1959;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1929;&amp;#1963;&amp;#1936;&amp;#1959;) ([[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian government and the president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. Mr. Moosa is currently living in self proclaimed exile in [[United Kingdom]] with his wife and 5   children.


==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons. In [[2002]] they had an amicable [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondary education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
[[Image:Sappeonbbc.jpg|thumb|200px|Ahmed Moosa on [[BBC]] World Asia Today program, [[June 10]],  [[2004]]]]
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''' ([[Dhivehi]]: &amp;#1927;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1931;&amp;#1962; &amp;#1949;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1930;&amp;#1961;&amp;#1934;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1927;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1924;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1923;&amp;#1959;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1929;&amp;#1963;&amp;#1936;&amp;#1959;) ('''b.''' [[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian [[government]] and the president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. Moosa is currently living in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family.


==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons. In [[2002]] they had an amicable [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondarys education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
[[Image:Sappeonbbc.jpg|thumb|200px|Ahmed Moosa on [[BBC]] World Asia Today program, [[June 10]],  [[2004]]]]
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''' ([[Dhivehi]]: &amp;#1927;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1931;&amp;#1962; &amp;#1949;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1930;&amp;#1961;&amp;#1934;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1927;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1924;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1923;&amp;#1959;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1929;&amp;#1963;&amp;#1936;&amp;#1959;) ('''b.''' [[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian [[government]] and the president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. Moosa is currently living in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family.


==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons. In [[2002]] they had an amicable [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondarys education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
[[Image:Sappeonbbc.jpg|thumb|200px|Ahmed Moosa on [[BBC]] World Asia Today program, [[June 10]],  [[2004]]]]
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

[[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian [[government]] and the president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. Moosa is currently living in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family.


==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons. In [[2002]] they had a [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondarys education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
[[Image:Sappeonbbc.jpg|thumb|200px|Ahmed Moosa on [[BBC]] World Asia Today program, [[June 10]],  [[2004]]]]
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions.

Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''' ([[Dhivehi]]: &amp;#1927;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1931;&amp;#1962; &amp;#1949;&amp;#1958;&amp;#1930;&amp;#1961;&amp;#1934;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1927;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1924;&amp;#1968;&amp;#1923;&amp;#1959;&amp;#1920;&amp;#1960;&amp;#1929;&amp;#1968; &amp;#1929;&amp;#1963;&amp;#1936;&amp;#1959;) ('''b.''' [[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian [[government]] and the president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. Moosa is currently living in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family.


Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons. In [[2002]] they had a [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondarys education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons. In [[2002]] they had a [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondarys education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

[[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian [[government]] and the president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. Moosa is currently living in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family.

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons. In [[2002]] they had a [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of Malé as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], current finance minister and [[Maldivian Peoples Party|DRP's]] (ruling party) deputy leader.[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm] Moosa is currently a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondarys education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on [[September 15]], [[2006]], Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email  by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on [[April 11]], [[2005]]. Mr. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in [[London]]. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''' ([[Dhivehi]]: އަހްމަދު ޝަފީގް އިބްރާހިމް މޫސާ) ('''b.''' [[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian [[government]] and the president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. Moosa is currently living in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family.

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons. In [[2002]] they had a [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of Malé as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], current finance minister and [[Maldivian Peoples Party|DRP's]] (ruling party) deputy leader.[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm] Moosa is currently a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondarys education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on [[September 15]], [[2006]], Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email  by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on [[April 11]], [[2005]]. Mr. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in [[London]]. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''' ([[Dhivehi]]: އަހްމަދު ޝަފީގް އިބްރާހިމް މޫސާ) ('''b.''' [[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian [[government]] and the president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. Moosa is currently living in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family.

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in 1993, with whom  he had three sons. In 2002 they had a [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of Malé as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], current finance minister and [[Maldivian Peoples Party|DRP's]] (ruling party) deputy leader.[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm] Moosa is currently a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondarys education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In 1990 he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] (October 2003), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on [[September 15]], [[2006]], Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email  by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on [[April 11]], [[2005]]. Mr. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in [[London]]. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''' ([[Dhivehi]]: އަހްމަދު ޝަފީގް އިބްރާހިމް މޫސާ) ('''b.''' [[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a founding member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to it's first general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian [[government]] and the former president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. Moosa lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003 - 2008. MDP won the Presidential Election held in October 2008.
Mr. Moosa was appointed Special Envoy for Science and Technology on &lt;ref&gt;11th March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/pages/eng_news.php?news:5388:1. 

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married Miranda Moosa in 1993, with whom he had three sons. The marriage ended in a divorcen in 2002. Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of Malé as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], current finance minister and [[Maldivian Peoples Party|DRP's]] (ruling party) deputy leader.[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm] Moosa is currently a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK). 

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondarys education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In 1990 he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] (October 2003), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on [[September 15]], [[2006]], Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email  by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on [[April 11]], [[2005]]. Mr. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in [[London]]. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.

He is the founder and Editor in Chief of the influential news website Dhivehi Observer. [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com][http://www.dhivehi-observer.com/aboutus.html]

Mr. Moosa senior member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to it's first General Council. He was a  widely  outspoken critic of the former president [[Gayoom]]. He lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003 - 2008. [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] won the Presidential Election held in October 2008.

Mr. Moosa is normally resident in [[Glasgow]], [[United Kingdom]].

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 2003 and has three sons from that marriage. He married again to his current wife, Fathimath Moosa, with whom he has a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of Malé as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], former finance minister and leader of Jumhooree Pary, which is part of the current government coalition.[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm] Moosa was also a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK). 

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondarys education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In 1990 he  acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] in Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] (October 2003), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

He is the founder and Editor in Chief of the influential news website Dhivehi Observer. [http://www.dhivehiobserver.com][http://www.dhivehi-observer.com/aboutus.html]

Mr. Moosa senior member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to its first General Council. He was a  widely  outspoken critic of the former president [[Gayoom]]. He lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003 - 2008. [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] won the Presidential Election held in October 2008.

Mr. Moosa is normally resident in [[Glasgow]], [[United Kingdom]].

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 2003 and has three sons from that marriage. He married again to his current wife, Fathimath Moosa, with whom he has a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing &amp; publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of Malé as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], former finance minister and leader of Jumhooree Pary, which is part of the current government coalition.[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm] Moosa was also a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK). 

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondarys education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In 1990 he  acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] in Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] (October 2003), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on [[September 15]], [[2006]], Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email  by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on [[April 11]], [[2005]]. Mr. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in [[London]]. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], former finance minister and leader of Jumhooree Party, which is part of the current government coalition.[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm] Moosa was also a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

The interview,  however, was aired on October 17, 2003. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on November 10, 2003, soon after its  official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] (October 2003), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], former finance minister and leader of Jumhooree Party, which is part of the current government coalition. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S.

The interview,  however, was aired on October 17, 2003. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country  fearing the worst&quot; said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on November 10, 2003, soon after its  official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] (October 2003), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.

Moosa is the President's Envoy for Science and Technology. He was appointed on 11 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/maldives-aims-to-become-first-carbonneutral-country-1644907.html ''The Independent'' &quot;Maldives aims to become first carbon-neutral country&quot;, 14 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is amongst those who campaigned for democracy and human rights which led to the end of the 30 year rule of [[Gayoom]] in November 2008. He is the founder and editor in chief of the news website Dhivehi Observer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com ''Dhivehi Observer'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html ''Dhivehi Observer:About Us'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is a senior member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to its first General Council. He was a widely outspoken critic of the former president [[Gayoom]]. He lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003 - 2008. The opposition Coalition won the Presidential Election held in October 2008.

Moosa is normally resident in [[Glasgow]], United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 2003 and has three sons from that marriage. He married secondly Fathimath Moosa, with whom he has a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], former finance minister and leader of the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I. Moosa, Personal Details]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa was also a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondary education at the [[Malé English School]], Malé. In 1990 he  acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a B. Eng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in  metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
In 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]], covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/15/wmald15.xml ''The Telegraph'' &quot;UK police warn wife of Maldives policeman over threat&quot;, 15 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is the President's Envoy for Science and Technology. He was appointed on 11 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/maldives-aims-to-become-first-carbonneutral-country-1644907.html ''The Independent'' &quot;Maldives aims to become first carbon-neutral country&quot;, 14 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is amongst those who campaigned for democracy and human rights which led to the end of the 30 year rule of [[Gayoom]] in November 2008. He is the founder and editor in chief of the news website Dhivehi Observer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com ''Dhivehi Observer'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html ''Dhivehi Observer:About Us'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is a senior member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to its first General Council. He was a widely outspoken critic of the former president [[Gayoom]]. He lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003 - 2008. The opposition Coalition won the Presidential Election held in October 2008.

Moosa is normally resident in [[Glasgow]], United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 2003 and has three sons from that marriage. He married secondly Fathimath Moosa, with whom he has a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Pvt Ltd. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], former finance minister and leader of the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I. Moosa, Personal Details]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa was also a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondary education at the [[Malé English School]], Malé. In 1990 he  acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a B. Eng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in  metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
In 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]], covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/15/wmald15.xml ''The Telegraph'' &quot;UK police warn wife of Maldives policeman over threat&quot;, 15 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Aboutrika''' ({{lang-ar|محمد أبو تريكة}}; born 7 November 1978) is an [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] [[Association football|footballer]]. Aboutrika plays as a second striker and as an attacking midfielder for the [[Egypt]]ian team [[Al-Ahly S.C.|Al-Ahly]] and the [[Egypt national football team|Egyptian national football team]].

He was nominated for the 2006 CAF African Footballer of the Year award, and he came second in the 2008 African Footballer of The Year award. It is said that he is one of Egypt's most valuable players.
He helped his team Al-Ahly to get the bronze medal in the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup|2006]]. He also won with the Egyptian national team the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations in 2006]]. Aboutrika scored the winning goal to help Egypt win the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]].

== Early life ==
Aboutrika was born in Giza, Egypt.

== Aboutrika's career ==

=== 2004 ===
In the first part of Egyptian league 2003-2004, Aboutrika scored 3 goals for Tersana. He was offered a position in Egypt's and one of Africa's top football teams, Al-Ahly. He scored 11 goals in his first and only 13 appearances with [[Al-Ahly S.C.|Al-Ahly]] in 2003-2004 league, coming in the second place between top scorers in the Egyptian League with 14 goals.

Since 2004 when he joined Al-Ahly Club, Aboutrika has scored 11 goals in the Egypt Derby against [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]], which is the top record of goals,after him comes emad moteab with 10 goals

Aboutrika's efforts with Ahly led to attention from the Egyptian national team, and he debuted against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in a friendly match before the World Cup 2006 qualifiers on 31 March 2004 in [[Arab Contractors Stadium]]. His debut game ended 2-1 for the Egyptians. He started as an attacker, but was found to play better when he played his normal position behind the attackers in the midfield position. Aboutrika scored his first national goal in this game. He scored 5 goals in his first 6 appearances with Egypt.

=== 2005 ===
In 2005, Al-Ahly regained the [[Egyptian League]] Championship after four years out of top position, Aboutrika came in the third place between topscorers in the Egyptian League with 9 goals, and helped his team mate [[Emad Moteab]] to be the top scorer of competition. Also in 2005, Aboutrika played a great role in Al-Ahly victory of the [[2005 CAF Champions League]], he scored an amazing goal in the final with an outrageous effort from 30 yards out against [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of Tunisia in a game ended 3-0 for Al-Ahly.

Al-Ahly qualified for [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]] but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: &quot;Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan&quot;.

Before Japan, with Aboutrika on board, Al-Ahly was about to make a new world record for the longest winning-streak for a football club. Some have commented that the combination with [[Emad Moteab]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]] formed the most formidable triangle in African Soccer, and they were given the moniker of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Angolan striker [[Flávio Amado]] replaces Barakat sometimes, playing a great role in forming this dangerous triangle.

=== 2006 ===
He proved to be his international team's trump card en route to victory in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] in February, when he scored two important goals against [[Libya national football team|Libya]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Ivory Coast]]. He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] when [[Amr Zaki]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar. In the final match, Aboutrika scored the decisive penalty in the shootout which gave Egypt the title.

Aboutrika led Al-Ahly to the [[2006 CAF Champions League]] title for the second successive time in November 2006. He was the top scorer of the competition with 8 goals, and scored the final match winning goal against [[CS Sfaxien]] in the 92nd minute.

He participated also with Al-Ahly in winning the [[CAF Super Cup]] against [[FAR Rabat]] of Morocco, days after the Africa Cup of Nations in February.

Locally, he got the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in June when he was the top scorer by 18 goals, and won [[Egypt Cup]], then the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] in July when he scored the winning goal against [[ENPPI]] in the 92nd minute despite having suffered an injury in the first half.

Japanese newspapers nominated Aboutrika to be one of the best players in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan, the last tournament in Aboutrika's great year. Al-Ahly was one of the African representatives, and the first team ever to be qualified two successive times to this championship, and the first African team to win a medal in that competition.

In the opening match of the tournament against [[Auckland City FC]] of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2-0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by stroking a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team. As well as netting with his delightful right-foot effort, Aboutrika was at the heart of most his side's best moves, dictating the rhythm with his skill and vision.

In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly faced Brazilian [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] on 13 December 2006, and Aboutrika played a good game, but his accurate shot hit the Brazilian right-hand post to deprive his team from a deserved draw. Al-Ahly lost the match 2-1, but proved a good efficiency, yet the ball refused to be netted in many available chances to score in Brazilian goalkeeper.[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/CWC/CWCMatchReport/0,4734,CWC-2006-2-01,00.html 'Match Report']

Al-Ahly faced [[Club América]] of Mexico, for the third place, and Aboutrika gave Al-Ahly the lead with an amazing free-kick over the wall, ending the first half 1-0 for Al-Ahly. In the second half, America made the draw, but as usual, Aboutrika appeared in the 79th minute with a skilled ball, he showed yet again why he is on the shortlist for the African player of the year. After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.

Aboutrika won all the competitions he participated in this year, and got the bronze medal for Al-Ahly in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]]. He was the top scorer in three competitions, which are [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] with 3 goals, [[Egyptian Premier League]] with 18 goals and [[2006 CAF Champions League]] with 8 goals. Aboutrika scored in other competitions, and made brilliant assistants to strikers.

=== African Footballer of the Year 2006 Nomination ===
Aboutrika, who is Egypt's newest idol according to the FIFA.com expression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL | title =Egypt's new idol | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070102013139/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated to win the 2006 CAF [[African Footballer of the Year]] award along with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] striker [[Didier Drogba]] and [[FC Barcelona]] forward [[Samuel Eto'o]]. The other nominees for the honour were [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] international midfielder [[Michael Essien]], who plays for English Giants [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and Nigeria's [[Nwankwo Kanu]], who has twice grabbed the award. Aboutrika said in November 2006: &quot;I would love to be nominated for the CAF Best Player award. That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika was the only African based player between nominees, but he is also the only one who made an achievement for his national team this year by winning [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations 2006]]. Aboutrika's brace in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and his dazzling performances throughout the season made him a serious contender for the CAF African Footballer of the Year award (as well as the BBC one) and secured his standing as Egypt's most popular personality. He did not win the prize but got second place and later was given &quot;best inter-club player&quot; and &quot;best player in the [[CAF Champions League]].&quot;

&quot;Aboutrika has won the highest prize any person can achieve, that is the love of the people,&quot; sports columnist Hassan Mistikawi wrote in the top-selling state-owned ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' daily.

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;. José sees Aboutrika as one of the best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: &quot;Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't imagine my team without him&quot;.

=== 2007 ===
In 2007, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Premier League]] (2006–2007) for the third successive season. Aboutrika scored 7 goals for his team, although he was injured. Al-Ahly won the [[Egypt Cup]] 2007 for the second successive time. Aboutrika was the top goalscorer of the competition with 4 goals. He scored a double kick memorable goal against [[Tala'ea El-Gaish SC]] in the 8-round game which ended 3-1 for Al-Ahly. In the final, Al-Ahly faced his rival [[Zamalek SC]]. Aboutrika made a one neck-saving equalizer in the last 2 minutes on 2 July 2007 in the [[Egypt Cup]] resulting in extra-time after tying 2-2. After El-Zamalek grabbed their third in the first half of extra-time, Aboutrika dazzeled the stands with two great balls, one an assisted cross over the whites' defense to [[Osama Hosny]] to score the equalizer in second half of extra-time in the first seconds of the game and within a minute, he surged between the Zamalek's midfield and passed two Zamalek players before providing an accurate through pass to [[Ahmad Sedik]] on the wing who went through on goal and assisted again for [[Osama Hosny]] for the late winner and holding high the Egyptian Cup. After that, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] 2007 for the third successive time, through shootouts, after tying 1-1 with [[Ismaily SC|Ismaily]].

In [[2007 CAF Champions League]], Aboutrika scored 4 goals for Al-Ahly until now, to raise his African goals to the number 15. Al-Ahly faced [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of [[Tunisia]] in the final match. Al-Ahly was having the chance to be the first team in the World to reach [[FIFA Club World Cup]] three successive times, and the first team in Africa to win [[CAF Champions League]] three successive times. However, the two legs ended seeing [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of Tunisia lifting the cup.

He won the title Best Player in Egypt for 2007 the fourth successive time after 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 setting a new Egyptian record.

=== 2008 ===
'''African Cup of Nations 2008'''

In 2008, Aboutrika scored 4 goals for Egypt in the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]].

Aboutrika also scored a goal in the semi-final against [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Ivory Coast]], and scored twice against [[Sudan national football team|Sudan]] in Egypt's group stage match.

In the previous tournament in [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|2006]], he scored the latest decisive penalty shootout in the final match against Ivory Coast to give Egypt the cup. With his team Al-Ahly of Egypt, Aboutrika was the hero of final matches again, through scoring a goal in the final match second leg both [[2006 CAF Champions League|2006]] and [[2005 CAF Champions League]] helping his team lift the continental cup.

Aboutrika nominated the best player in the in Ghana 2008 final match.

After the friendly match against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], Aboutrika had an injury which deprived him from being a member along the national team in the first 4 matches played in June, in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers]]. He marked his national return against [[DR Congo national football team|Congo DR]] in [[Kinshasa]] on 7 September 2008 scoring the winning goal for Egypt, to secure the Pharaohs' place in the second round of Qualifications. He scored another goal in his second match in the qualifiers against [[Djibouti national football team|Djibouti]].

Egypt started with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on 15 June, a game ended 4-3 for the Brazilian side. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's two goals, to his team mate [[Mohamed Zidan]] who scored twice.

The Italian sports journalist [[Gabriele Marcotti]] has also been highly impressed with Aboutrika's performance against Brazil, and praised Aboutrika's career with football in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Or, in fact, should he be admired for remaining loyal to his homeland, simply being happy with what he has achieved and not feeling the need to chase the glamour and millions of the Premier League or La Liga?''. }}

Egypt faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 18 June, a game ended with a victory 1-0 for Egypt. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's goal, to his team mate [[Mohamed Soliman|Mohamed Soliman &quot;Homos&quot;]] who scored with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers'''

On 7 June, Aboutrika scored in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in [[Algeria]] but Egypt lost 3-1.

On 4 July, Aboutrika played in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Rwanda national football team|Rwanda]] in [[Egypt]], helping the Egyptians win 3-0, and scored the first and the third goal, making the Egyptian team second after [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], in their group. Aboutrika reached his fifth goal in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers]].

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Aboutrika''' ({{lang-ar|محمد أبو تريكة}}; born 7 November 1978) is an [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] [[Association football|footballer]]. Aboutrika plays as a second striker and as an attacking midfielder for the [[Egypt]]ian team [[Al-Ahly S.C.|Al-Ahly]] and the [[Egypt national football team|Egyptian national football team]].

He was nominated for the 2006 CAF African Footballer of the Year award, and he came second in the 2008 African Footballer of The Year award. It is said that he is one of Egypt's most valuable players.
He helped his team Al-Ahly to get the bronze medal in the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup|2006]]. He also won with the Egyptian national team the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations in 2006]]. Aboutrika scored the winning goal to help Egypt win the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]].

== Early life ==
Aboutrika was born in Giza, Egypt.

== Aboutrika's career ==

=== 2004 ===
In the first part of Egyptian league 2003-2004, Aboutrika scored 3 goals for Tersana. He was offered a position in Egypt's and one of Africa's top football teams, Al-Ahly. He scored 11 goals in his first and only 13 appearances with [[Al-Ahly S.C.|Al-Ahly]] in 2003-2004 league, coming in the second place between top scorers in the Egyptian League with 14 goals.

Since 2004 when he joined Al-Ahly Club, Aboutrika has scored 11 goals in the Egypt Derby against [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]], which is the top record of goals,after him comes emad moteab with 10 goals

Aboutrika's efforts with Ahly led to attention from the Egyptian national team, and he debuted against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in a friendly match before the World Cup 2006 qualifiers on 31 March 2004 in [[Arab Contractors Stadium]]. His debut game ended 2-1 for the Egyptians. He started as an attacker, but was found to play better when he played his normal position behind the attackers in the midfield position. Aboutrika scored his first national goal in this game. He scored 5 goals in his first 6 appearances with Egypt.

=== 2005 ===
In 2005, Al-Ahly regained the [[Egyptian League]] Championship after four years out of top position, Aboutrika came in the third place between topscorers in the Egyptian League with 9 goals, and helped his team mate [[Emad Moteab]] to be the top scorer of competition. Also in 2005, Aboutrika played a great role in Al-Ahly victory of the [[2005 CAF Champions League]], he scored an amazing goal in the final with an outrageous effort from 30 yards out against [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of Tunisia in a game ended 3-0 for Al-Ahly.

Al-Ahly qualified for [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]] but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: &quot;Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan&quot;.

Before Japan, with Aboutrika on board, Al-Ahly was about to make a new world record for the longest winning-streak for a football club. Some have commented that the combination with [[Emad Moteab]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]] formed the most formidable triangle in African Soccer, and they were given the moniker of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Angolan striker [[Flávio Amado]] replaces Barakat sometimes, playing a great role in forming this dangerous triangle.

=== 2006 ===
He proved to be his international team's trump card en route to victory in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] in February, when he scored two important goals against [[Libya national football team|Libya]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Ivory Coast]]. He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] when [[Amr Zaki]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar. In the final match, Aboutrika scored the decisive penalty in the shootout which gave Egypt the title.

Aboutrika led Al-Ahly to the [[2006 CAF Champions League]] title for the second successive time in November 2006. He was the top scorer of the competition with 8 goals, and scored the final match winning goal against [[CS Sfaxien]] in the 92nd minute.

He participated also with Al-Ahly in winning the [[CAF Super Cup]] against [[FAR Rabat]] of Morocco, days after the Africa Cup of Nations in February.

Locally, he got the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in June when he was the top scorer by 18 goals, and won [[Egypt Cup]], then the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] in July when he scored the winning goal against [[ENPPI]] in the 92nd minute despite having suffered an injury in the first half.

Japanese newspapers nominated Aboutrika to be one of the best players in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan, the last tournament in Aboutrika's great year. Al-Ahly was one of the African representatives, and the first team ever to be qualified two successive times to this championship, and the first African team to win a medal in that competition.

In the opening match of the tournament against [[Auckland City FC]] of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2-0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by stroking a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team. As well as netting with his delightful right-foot effort, Aboutrika was at the heart of most his side's best moves, dictating the rhythm with his skill and vision.

In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly faced Brazilian [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] on 13 December 2006, and Aboutrika played a good game, but his accurate shot hit the Brazilian right-hand post to deprive his team from a deserved draw. Al-Ahly lost the match 2-1, but proved a good efficiency, yet the ball refused to be netted in many available chances to score in Brazilian goalkeeper.[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/CWC/CWCMatchReport/0,4734,CWC-2006-2-01,00.html 'Match Report']

Al-Ahly faced [[Club América]] of Mexico, for the third place, and Aboutrika gave Al-Ahly the lead with an amazing free-kick over the wall, ending the first half 1-0 for Al-Ahly. In the second half, America made the draw, but as usual, Aboutrika appeared in the 79th minute with a skilled ball, he showed yet again why he is on the shortlist for the African player of the year. After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.

Aboutrika won all the competitions he participated in this year, and got the bronze medal for Al-Ahly in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]]. He was the top scorer in three competitions, which are [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] with 3 goals, [[Egyptian Premier League]] with 18 goals and [[2006 CAF Champions League]] with 8 goals. Aboutrika scored in other competitions, and made brilliant assistants to strikers.

That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika was the only African based player between nominees, but he is also the only one who made an achievement for his national team this year by winning [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations 2006]]. Aboutrika's brace in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and his dazzling performances throughout the season made him a serious contender for the CAF African Footballer of the Year award (as well as the BBC one) and secured his standing as Egypt's most popular personality. He did not win the prize but got second place and later was given &quot;best inter-club player&quot; and &quot;best player in the [[CAF Champions League]].&quot;

&quot;Aboutrika has won the highest prize any person can achieve, that is the love of the people,&quot; sports columnist Hassan Mistikawi wrote in the top-selling state-owned ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' daily.

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;. José sees Aboutrika as one of the best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: &quot;Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't imagine my team without him&quot;.

=== 2007 ===
In 2007, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Premier League]] (2006–2007) for the third successive season. Aboutrika scored 7 goals for his team, although he was injured. Al-Ahly won the [[Egypt Cup]] 2007 for the second successive time. Aboutrika was the top goalscorer of the competition with 4 goals. He scored a double kick memorable goal against [[Tala'ea El-Gaish SC]] in the 8-round game which ended 3-1 for Al-Ahly. In the final, Al-Ahly faced his rival [[Zamalek SC]]. Aboutrika made a one neck-saving equalizer in the last 2 minutes on 2 July 2007 in the [[Egypt Cup]] resulting in extra-time after tying 2-2. After El-Zamalek grabbed their third in the first half of extra-time, Aboutrika dazzeled the stands with two great balls, one an assisted cross over the whites' defense to [[Osama Hosny]] to score the equalizer in second half of extra-time in the first seconds of the game and within a minute, he surged between the Zamalek's midfield and passed two Zamalek players before providing an accurate through pass to [[Ahmad Sedik]] on the wing who went through on goal and assisted again for [[Osama Hosny]] for the late winner and holding high the Egyptian Cup. After that, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] 2007 for the third successive time, through shootouts, after tying 1-1 with [[Ismaily SC|Ismaily]].

In [[2007 CAF Champions League]], Aboutrika scored 4 goals for Al-Ahly until now, to raise his African goals to the number 15. Al-Ahly faced [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of [[Tunisia]] in the final match. Al-Ahly was having the chance to be the first team in the World to reach [[FIFA Club World Cup]] three successive times, and the first team in Africa to win [[CAF Champions League]] three successive times. However, the two legs ended seeing [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of Tunisia lifting the cup.

Or, in fact, should he be admired for remaining loyal to his homeland, simply being happy with what he has achieved and not feeling the need to chase the glamour and millions of the Premier League or La Liga?''. }}

Egypt faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 18 June, a game ended with a victory 1-0 for Egypt. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's goal, to his team mate [[Mohamed Soliman|Mohamed Soliman &quot;Homos&quot;]] who scored with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Aboutrika reached his fifth goal in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers]].

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika plays as a second striker and as an attacking midfielder for the [[Egypt]]ian team [[Al-Ahly S.C.|Al-Ahly]] and the [[Egypt national football team|Egyptian national football team]].

He helped his team Al-Ahly to get the bronze medal in the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup|2006]]. He also won with the Egyptian national team the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations in 2006]]. Aboutrika scored the winning goal to help Egypt win the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]].

== Early life ==
Aboutrika was born in Giza, Egypt.

== Aboutrika's career ==

=== 2004 ===
In the first part of Egyptian league 2003-2004, Aboutrika scored 3 goals for Tersana. He was offered a position in Egypt's and one of Africa's top football teams, Al-Ahly. He scored 11 goals in his first and only 13 appearances with [[Al-Ahly S.C.|Al-Ahly]] in 2003-2004 league, coming in the second place between top scorers in the Egyptian League with 14 goals.

Since 2004 when he joined Al-Ahly Club, Aboutrika has scored 11 goals in the Egypt Derby against [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]], which is the top record of goals,after him comes emad moteab with 10 goals

Aboutrika's efforts with Ahly led to attention from the Egyptian national team, and he debuted against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in a friendly match before the World Cup 2006 qualifiers on 31 March 2004 in [[Arab Contractors Stadium]]. His debut game ended 2-1 for the Egyptians. He started as an attacker, but was found to play better when he played his normal position behind the attackers in the midfield position. Aboutrika scored his first national goal in this game. He scored 5 goals in his first 6 appearances with Egypt.

=== 2005 ===
In 2005, Al-Ahly regained the [[Egyptian League]] Championship after four years out of top position, Aboutrika came in the third place between topscorers in the Egyptian League with 9 goals, and helped his team mate [[Emad Moteab]] to be the top scorer of competition. Also in 2005, Aboutrika played a great role in Al-Ahly victory of the [[2005 CAF Champions League]], he scored an amazing goal in the final with an outrageous effort from 30 yards out against [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of Tunisia in a game ended 3-0 for Al-Ahly.

Al-Ahly qualified for [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]] but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: &quot;Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan&quot;.

Before Japan, with Aboutrika on board, Al-Ahly was about to make a new world record for the longest winning-streak for a football club. Some have commented that the combination with [[Emad Moteab]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]] formed the most formidable triangle in African Soccer, and they were given the moniker of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Angolan striker [[Flávio Amado]] replaces Barakat sometimes, playing a great role in forming this dangerous triangle.

=== 2006 ===
He proved to be his international team's trump card en route to victory in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] in February, when he scored two important goals against [[Libya national football team|Libya]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Ivory Coast]]. He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] when [[Amr Zaki]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar. In the final match, Aboutrika scored the decisive penalty in the shootout which gave Egypt the title.

Aboutrika led Al-Ahly to the [[2006 CAF Champions League]] title for the second successive time in November 2006. He was the top scorer of the competition with 8 goals, and scored the final match winning goal against [[CS Sfaxien]] in the 92nd minute.

He participated also with Al-Ahly in winning the [[CAF Super Cup]] against [[FAR Rabat]] of Morocco, days after the Africa Cup of Nations in February.

Locally, he got the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in June when he was the top scorer by 18 goals, and won [[Egypt Cup]], then the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] in July when he scored the winning goal against [[ENPPI]] in the 92nd minute despite having suffered an injury in the first half.

Japanese newspapers nominated Aboutrika to be one of the best players in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan, the last tournament in Aboutrika's great year. Al-Ahly was one of the African representatives, and the first team ever to be qualified two successive times to this championship, and the first African team to win a medal in that competition.

In the opening match of the tournament against [[Auckland City FC]] of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2-0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by stroking a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team. As well as netting with his delightful right-foot effort, Aboutrika was at the heart of most his side's best moves, dictating the rhythm with his skill and vision.

In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly faced Brazilian [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] on 13 December 2006, and Aboutrika played a good game, but his accurate shot hit the Brazilian right-hand post to deprive his team from a deserved draw. Al-Ahly lost the match 2-1, but proved a good efficiency, yet the ball refused to be netted in many available chances to score in Brazilian goalkeeper.[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/CWC/CWCMatchReport/0,4734,CWC-2006-2-01,00.html 'Match Report']

Al-Ahly faced [[Club América]] of Mexico, for the third place, and Aboutrika gave Al-Ahly the lead with an amazing free-kick over the wall, ending the first half 1-0 for Al-Ahly. In the second half, America made the draw, but as usual, Aboutrika appeared in the 79th minute with a skilled ball, he showed yet again why he is on the shortlist for the African player of the year. After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.

Aboutrika won all the competitions he participated in this year, and got the bronze medal for Al-Ahly in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]]. He was the top scorer in three competitions, which are [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] with 3 goals, [[Egyptian Premier League]] with 18 goals and [[2006 CAF Champions League]] with 8 goals. Aboutrika scored in other competitions, and made brilliant assistants to strikers.

=== African Footballer of the Year 2006 Nomination ===
Aboutrika, who is Egypt's newest idol according to the FIFA.com expression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL | title =Egypt's new idol | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070102013139/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated to win the 2006 CAF [[African Footballer of the Year]] award along with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] striker [[Didier Drogba]] and [[FC Barcelona]] forward [[Samuel Eto'o]]. The other nominees for the honour were [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] international midfielder [[Michael Essien]], who plays for English Giants [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and Nigeria's [[Nwankwo Kanu]], who has twice grabbed the award. Aboutrika said in November 2006: &quot;I would love to be nominated for the CAF Best Player award. That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika was the only African based player between nominees, but he is also the only one who made an achievement for his national team this year by winning [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations 2006]]. Aboutrika's brace in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and his dazzling performances throughout the season made him a serious contender for the CAF African Footballer of the Year award (as well as the BBC one) and secured his standing as Egypt's most popular personality. He did not win the prize but got second place and later was given &quot;best inter-club player&quot; and &quot;best player in the [[CAF Champions League]].&quot;

&quot;Aboutrika has won the highest prize any person can achieve, that is the love of the people,&quot; sports columnist Hassan Mistikawi wrote in the top-selling state-owned ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' daily.

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;. José sees Aboutrika as one of the best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: &quot;Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't imagine my team without him&quot;.

=== 2007 ===
In 2007, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Premier League]] (2006–2007) for the third successive season. Aboutrika scored 7 goals for his team, although he was injured.

He scored a double kick memorable goal against [[Tala'ea El-Gaish SC]] in the 8-round game which ended 3-1 for Al-Ahly. In the final, Al-Ahly faced his rival [[Zamalek SC]]. Aboutrika made a one neck-saving equalizer in the last 2 minutes on 2 July 2007 in the [[Egypt Cup]] resulting in extra-time after tying 2-2. After El-Zamalek grabbed their third in the first half of extra-time, Aboutrika dazzeled the stands with two great balls, one an assisted cross over the whites' defense to [[Osama Hosny]] to score the equalizer in second half of extra-time in the first seconds of the game and within a minute, he surged between the Zamalek's midfield and passed two Zamalek players before providing an accurate through pass to [[Ahmad Sedik]] on the wing who went through on goal and assisted again for [[Osama Hosny]] for the late winner and holding high the Egyptian Cup. After that, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] 2007 for the third successive time, through shootouts, after tying 1-1 with [[Ismaily SC|Ismaily]].

In [[2007 CAF Champions League]], Aboutrika scored 4 goals for Al-Ahly until now, to raise his African goals to the number 15. Al-Ahly faced [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of [[Tunisia]] in the final match. Al-Ahly was having the chance to be the first team in the World to reach [[FIFA Club World Cup]] three successive times, and the first team in Africa to win [[CAF Champions League]] three successive times.

Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate.

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Aboutrika''' ({{lang-ar|محمد أبو تريكة}}; born 7 November 1978) is an [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] [[Association football|footballer]]. Aboutrika plays as a second striker and as an attacking midfielder for the [[Egypt]]ian team [[Al-Ahly S.C.|Al-Ahly]] and the [[Egypt national football team|Egyptian national football team]].

He was nominated for the 2006 CAF African Footballer of the Year award, and he came second in the 2008 African Footballer of The Year award. It is said that he is one of Egypt's most valuable players.
He helped his team Al-Ahly to get the bronze medal in the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup|2006]]. He also won with the Egyptian national team the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations in 2006]]. Aboutrika scored the winning goal to help Egypt win the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]].

== Early life ==
Aboutrika was born in Giza, Egypt.

== Aboutrika's career ==

=== 2004 ===
In the first part of Egyptian league 2003-2004, Aboutrika scored 3 goals for Tersana. He was offered a position in Egypt's and one of Africa's top football teams, Al-Ahly. He scored 11 goals in his first and only 13 appearances with [[Al-Ahly S.C.|Al-Ahly]] in 2003-2004 league, coming in the second place between top scorers in the Egyptian League with 14 goals.

Since 2004 when he joined Al-Ahly Club, Aboutrika has scored 11 goals in the Egypt Derby against [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]], which is the top record of goals,after him comes emad moteab with 10 goals

Aboutrika's efforts with Ahly led to attention from the Egyptian national team, and he debuted against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in a friendly match before the World Cup 2006 qualifiers on 31 March 2004 in [[Arab Contractors Stadium]]. His debut game ended 2-1 for the Egyptians. He started as an attacker, but was found to play better when he played his normal position behind the attackers in the midfield position. Aboutrika scored his first national goal in this game. He scored 5 goals in his first 6 appearances with Egypt.

=== 2005 ===
In 2005, Al-Ahly regained the [[Egyptian League]] Championship after four years out of top position, Aboutrika came in the third place between topscorers in the Egyptian League with 9 goals, and helped his team mate [[Emad Moteab]] to be the top scorer of competition. Also in 2005, Aboutrika played a great role in Al-Ahly victory of the [[2005 CAF Champions League]], he scored an amazing goal in the final with an outrageous effort from 30 yards out against [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of Tunisia in a game ended 3-0 for Al-Ahly.

Al-Ahly qualified for [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]] but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: &quot;Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan&quot;.

Before Japan, with Aboutrika on board, Al-Ahly was about to make a new world record for the longest winning-streak for a football club. Some have commented that the combination with [[Emad Moteab]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]] formed the most formidable triangle in African Soccer, and they were given the moniker of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Angolan striker [[Flávio Amado]] replaces Barakat sometimes, playing a great role in forming this dangerous triangle.

=== 2006 ===
He proved to be his international team's trump card en route to victory in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] in February, when he scored two important goals against [[Libya national football team|Libya]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Ivory Coast]]. He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] when [[Amr Zaki]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar. In the final match, Aboutrika scored the decisive penalty in the shootout which gave Egypt the title.

Aboutrika led Al-Ahly to the [[2006 CAF Champions League]] title for the second successive time in November 2006. He was the top scorer of the competition with 8 goals, and scored the final match winning goal against [[CS Sfaxien]] in the 92nd minute.

He participated also with Al-Ahly in winning the [[CAF Super Cup]] against [[FAR Rabat]] of Morocco, days after the Africa Cup of Nations in February.

Locally, he got the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in June when he was the top scorer by 18 goals, and won [[Egypt Cup]], then the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] in July when he scored the winning goal against [[ENPPI]] in the 92nd minute despite having suffered an injury in the first half.

Japanese newspapers nominated Aboutrika to be one of the best players in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan, the last tournament in Aboutrika's great year. Al-Ahly was one of the African representatives, and the first team ever to be qualified two successive times to this championship, and the first African team to win a medal in that competition.

In the opening match of the tournament against [[Auckland City FC]] of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2-0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by stroking a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team. As well as netting with his delightful right-foot effort, Aboutrika was at the heart of most his side's best moves, dictating the rhythm with his skill and vision.

In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly faced Brazilian [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] on 13 December 2006, and Aboutrika played a good game, but his accurate shot hit the Brazilian right-hand post to deprive his team from a deserved draw. Al-Ahly lost the match 2-1, but proved a good efficiency, yet the ball refused to be netted in many available chances to score in Brazilian goalkeeper.[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/CWC/CWCMatchReport/0,4734,CWC-2006-2-01,00.html 'Match Report']

Al-Ahly faced [[Club América]] of Mexico, for the third place, and Aboutrika gave Al-Ahly the lead with an amazing free-kick over the wall, ending the first half 1-0 for Al-Ahly. In the second half, America made the draw, but as usual, Aboutrika appeared in the 79th minute with a skilled ball, he showed yet again why he is on the shortlist for the African player of the year. After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.

Aboutrika won all the competitions he participated in this year, and got the bronze medal for Al-Ahly in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]]. He was the top scorer in three competitions, which are [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] with 3 goals, [[Egyptian Premier League]] with 18 goals and [[2006 CAF Champions League]] with 8 goals. Aboutrika scored in other competitions, and made brilliant assistants to strikers.

=== African Footballer of the Year 2006 Nomination ===
Aboutrika, who is Egypt's newest idol according to the FIFA.com expression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL | title =Egypt's new idol | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070102013139/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated to win the 2006 CAF [[African Footballer of the Year]] award along with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] striker [[Didier Drogba]] and [[FC Barcelona]] forward [[Samuel Eto'o]]. The other nominees for the honour were [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] international midfielder [[Michael Essien]], who plays for English Giants [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and Nigeria's [[Nwankwo Kanu]], who has twice grabbed the award. Aboutrika said in November 2006: &quot;I would love to be nominated for the CAF Best Player award. That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika was the only African based player between nominees, but he is also the only one who made an achievement for his national team this year by winning [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations 2006]]. Aboutrika's brace in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and his dazzling performances throughout the season made him a serious contender for the CAF African Footballer of the Year award (as well as the BBC one) and secured his standing as Egypt's most popular personality. He did not win the prize but got second place and later was given &quot;best inter-club player&quot; and &quot;best player in the [[CAF Champions League]].&quot;

&quot;Aboutrika has won the highest prize any person can achieve, that is the love of the people,&quot; sports columnist Hassan Mistikawi wrote in the top-selling state-owned ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' daily.

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;. José sees Aboutrika as one of the best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: &quot;Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't imagine my team without him&quot;.

=== 2007 ===
In 2007, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Premier League]] (2006–2007) for the third successive season. Aboutrika scored 7 goals for his team, although he was injured. Al-Ahly won the [[Egypt Cup]] 2007 for the second successive time. Aboutrika was the top goalscorer of the competition with 4 goals. He scored a double kick memorable goal against [[Tala'ea El-Gaish SC]] in the 8-round game which ended 3-1 for Al-Ahly. In the final, Al-Ahly faced his rival [[Zamalek SC]]. Aboutrika made a one neck-saving equalizer in the last 2 minutes on 2 July 2007 in the [[Egypt Cup]] resulting in extra-time after tying 2-2. After El-Zamalek grabbed their third in the first half of extra-time, Aboutrika dazzeled the stands with two great balls, one an assisted cross over the whites' defense to [[Osama Hosny]] to score the equalizer in second half of extra-time in the first seconds of the game and within a minute, he surged between the Zamalek's midfield and passed two Zamalek players before providing an accurate through pass to [[Ahmad Sedik]] on the wing who went through on goal and assisted again for [[Osama Hosny]] for the late winner and holding high the Egyptian Cup. After that, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] 2007 for the third successive time, through shootouts, after tying 1-1 with [[Ismaily SC|Ismaily]].

In [[2007 CAF Champions League]], Aboutrika scored 4 goals for Al-Ahly until now, to raise his African goals to the number 15. Al-Ahly faced [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of [[Tunisia]] in the final match. Al-Ahly was having the chance to be the first team in the World to reach [[FIFA Club World Cup]] three successive times, and the first team in Africa to win [[CAF Champions League]] three successive times. However, the two legs ended seeing [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of Tunisia lifting the cup.

He won the title Best Player in Egypt for 2007 the fourth successive time after 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 setting a new Egyptian record.

=== 2008 ===
'''African Cup of Nations 2008'''

In 2008, Aboutrika scored 4 goals for Egypt in the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]].

He marked his national return against [[DR Congo national football team|Congo DR]] in [[Kinshasa]] on 7 September 2008 scoring the winning goal for Egypt, to secure the Pharaohs' place in the second round of Qualifications. He scored another goal in his second match in the qualifiers against [[Djibouti national football team|Djibouti]].

=== 2009 ===
'''Confederations Cup 2009'''

Aboutrika was a member in Egypt football national team line-up in [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. Egypt falls in Group B along with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]].

Egypt started with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on 15 June, a game ended 4-3 for the Brazilian side. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's two goals, to his team mate [[Mohamed Zidan]] who scored twice.

The Italian sports journalist [[Gabriele Marcotti]] has also been highly impressed with Aboutrika's performance against Brazil, and praised Aboutrika's career with football in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Or, in fact, should he be admired for remaining loyal to his homeland, simply being happy with what he has achieved and not feeling the need to chase the glamour and millions of the Premier League or La Liga?''. }}

Egypt faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 18 June, a game ended with a victory 1-0 for Egypt. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's goal, to his team mate [[Mohamed Soliman|Mohamed Soliman &quot;Homos&quot;]] who scored with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers'''

On 7 June, Aboutrika scored in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in [[Algeria]] but Egypt lost 3-1.

On 4 July, Aboutrika played in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Rwanda national football team|Rwanda]] in [[Egypt]], helping the Egyptians win 3-0, and scored the first and the third goal, making the Egyptian team second after [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], in their group. Aboutrika reached his fifth goal in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers]].

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed Aboutrika''' ({{lang-ar|محمد أبو تريكة}}; born 7 November 1978) is an [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] [[Association football|footballer]]. Aboutrika plays as a second striker and as an attacking midfielder for the [[Egypt]]ian team [[Al-Ahly S.C.|Al-Ahly]] and the [[Egypt national football team|Egyptian national football team]].

He was nominated for the 2006 CAF African Footballer of the Year award, and he came second in the 2008 African Footballer of The Year award. It is said that he is one of Egypt's most valuable players.
He helped his team Al-Ahly to get the bronze medal in the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup|2006]]. He also won with the Egyptian national team the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations in 2006]]. Aboutrika scored the winning goal to help Egypt win the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]].

''== Early life ==
Shehab was born in Qena, Egypt, but he lived in Gizah,Egypt, he loves Football very much as he keep training on it with himself.'''''Bold text'''

== Aboutrika's career ==

=== 2004 ===
In the first part of Egyptian league 2003-2004, Aboutrika scored 3 goals for Tersana. He was offered a position in Egypt's and one of Africa's top football teams, Al-Ahly. He scored 11 goals in his first and only 13 appearances with [[Al-Ahly S.C.|Al-Ahly]] in 2003-2004 league, coming in the second place between top scorers in the Egyptian League with 14 goals.

Since 2004 when he joined Al-Ahly Club, Aboutrika has scored 11 goals in the Egypt Derby against [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]], which is the top record of goals,after him comes emad moteab with 10 goals

Aboutrika's efforts with Ahly led to attention from the Egyptian national team, and he debuted against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in a friendly match before the World Cup 2006 qualifiers on 31 March 2004 in [[Arab Contractors Stadium]]. His debut game ended 2-1 for the Egyptians. He started as an attacker, but was found to play better when he played his normal position behind the attackers in the midfield position. Aboutrika scored his first national goal in this game. He scored 5 goals in his first 6 appearances with Egypt.

=== 2005 ===
In 2005, Al-Ahly regained the [[Egyptian League]] Championship after four years out of top position, Aboutrika came in the third place between topscorers in the Egyptian League with 9 goals, and helped his team mate [[Emad Moteab]] to be the top scorer of competition. Also in 2005, Aboutrika played a great role in Al-Ahly victory of the [[2005 CAF Champions League]], he scored an amazing goal in the final with an outrageous effort from 30 yards out against [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of Tunisia in a game ended 3-0 for Al-Ahly.

Al-Ahly qualified for [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]] but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: &quot;Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan&quot;.

Before Japan, with Aboutrika on board, Al-Ahly was about to make a new world record for the longest winning-streak for a football club. Some have commented that the combination with [[Emad Moteab]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]] formed the most formidable triangle in African Soccer, and they were given the moniker of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Angolan striker [[Flávio Amado]] replaces Barakat sometimes, playing a great role in forming this dangerous triangle.

=== 2006 ===
He proved to be his international team's trump card en route to victory in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] in February, when he scored two important goals against [[Libya national football team|Libya]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Ivory Coast]]. He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] when [[Amr Zaki]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar. In the final match, Aboutrika scored the decisive penalty in the shootout which gave Egypt the title.

Aboutrika led Al-Ahly to the [[2006 CAF Champions League]] title for the second successive time in November 2006. He was the top scorer of the competition with 8 goals, and scored the final match winning goal against [[CS Sfaxien]] in the 92nd minute.

He participated also with Al-Ahly in winning the [[CAF Super Cup]] against [[FAR Rabat]] of Morocco, days after the Africa Cup of Nations in February.

Locally, he got the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in June when he was the top scorer by 18 goals, and won [[Egypt Cup]], then the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] in July when he scored the winning goal against [[ENPPI]] in the 92nd minute despite having suffered an injury in the first half.

Japanese newspapers nominated Aboutrika to be one of the best players in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan, the last tournament in Aboutrika's great year. Al-Ahly was one of the African representatives, and the first team ever to be qualified two successive times to this championship, and the first African team to win a medal in that competition.

In the opening match of the tournament against [[Auckland City FC]] of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2-0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by stroking a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team. As well as netting with his delightful right-foot effort, Aboutrika was at the heart of most his side's best moves, dictating the rhythm with his skill and vision.

In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly faced Brazilian [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] on 13 December 2006, and Aboutrika played a good game, but his accurate shot hit the Brazilian right-hand post to deprive his team from a deserved draw. Al-Ahly lost the match 2-1, but proved a good efficiency, yet the ball refused to be netted in many available chances to score in Brazilian goalkeeper.[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/CWC/CWCMatchReport/0,4734,CWC-2006-2-01,00.html 'Match Report']

Al-Ahly faced [[Club América]] of Mexico, for the third place, and Aboutrika gave Al-Ahly the lead with an amazing free-kick over the wall, ending the first half 1-0 for Al-Ahly. In the second half, America made the draw, but as usual, Aboutrika appeared in the 79th minute with a skilled ball, he showed yet again why he is on the shortlist for the African player of the year. After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.

Aboutrika won all the competitions he participated in this year, and got the bronze medal for Al-Ahly in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]]. He was the top scorer in three competitions, which are [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] with 3 goals, [[Egyptian Premier League]] with 18 goals and [[2006 CAF Champions League]] with 8 goals. Aboutrika scored in other competitions, and made brilliant assistants to strikers.

=== African Footballer of the Year 2006 Nomination ===
Aboutrika, who is Egypt's newest idol according to the FIFA.com expression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL | title =Egypt's new idol | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070102013139/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated to win the 2006 CAF [[African Footballer of the Year]] award along with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] striker [[Didier Drogba]] and [[FC Barcelona]] forward [[Samuel Eto'o]]. The other nominees for the honour were [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] international midfielder [[Michael Essien]], who plays for English Giants [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and Nigeria's [[Nwankwo Kanu]], who has twice grabbed the award. Aboutrika said in November 2006: &quot;I would love to be nominated for the CAF Best Player award. That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika was the only African based player between nominees, but he is also the only one who made an achievement for his national team this year by winning [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations 2006]]. Aboutrika's brace in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and his dazzling performances throughout the season made him a serious contender for the CAF African Footballer of the Year award (as well as the BBC one) and secured his standing as Egypt's most popular personality. He did not win the prize but got second place and later was given &quot;best inter-club player&quot; and &quot;best player in the [[CAF Champions League]].&quot;

&quot;Aboutrika has won the highest prize any person can achieve, that is the love of the people,&quot; sports columnist Hassan Mistikawi wrote in the top-selling state-owned ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' daily.

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;. José sees Aboutrika as one of the best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: &quot;Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't imagine my team without him&quot;.

Egypt faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 18 June, a game ended with a victory 1-0 for Egypt. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's goal, to his team mate [[Mohamed Soliman|Mohamed Soliman &quot;Homos&quot;]] who scored with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;.

== Aboutrika's career ==

=== 2004 ===
In the first part of Egyptian league 2003-2004, Aboutrika scored 3 goals for Tersana. He was offered a position in Egypt's and one of Africa's top football teams, Al-Ahly. He scored 11 goals in his first and only 13 appearances with [[Al-Ahly S.C.|Al-Ahly]] in 2003-2004 league, coming in the second place between top scorers in the Egyptian League with 14 goals.

Since 2004 when he joined Al-Ahly Club, Aboutrika has scored 11 goals in the Egypt Derby against [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]], which is the top record of goals,after him comes emad moteab with 10 goals

Aboutrika's efforts with Ahly led to attention from the Egyptian national team, and he debuted against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in a friendly match before the World Cup 2006 qualifiers on 31 March 2004 in [[Arab Contractors Stadium]]. His debut game ended 2-1 for the Egyptians. He started as an attacker, but was found to play better when he played his normal position behind the attackers in the midfield position. Aboutrika scored his first national goal in this game. He scored 5 goals in his first 6 appearances with Egypt.

=== 2005 ===
In 2005, Al-Ahly regained the [[Egyptian League]] Championship after four years out of top position, Aboutrika came in the third place between topscorers in the Egyptian League with 9 goals, and helped his team mate [[Emad Moteab]] to be the top scorer of competition. Also in 2005, Aboutrika played a great role in Al-Ahly victory of the [[2005 CAF Champions League]], he scored an amazing goal in the final with an outrageous effort from 30 yards out against [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of Tunisia in a game ended 3-0 for Al-Ahly.

Al-Ahly qualified for [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]] but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: &quot;Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan&quot;.

Before Japan, with Aboutrika on board, Al-Ahly was about to make a new world record for the longest winning-streak for a football club. Some have commented that the combination with [[Emad Moteab]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]] formed the most formidable triangle in African Soccer, and they were given the moniker of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Angolan striker [[Flávio Amado]] replaces Barakat sometimes, playing a great role in forming this dangerous triangle.

=== 2006 ===
He proved to be his international team's trump card en route to victory in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] in February, when he scored two important goals against [[Libya national football team|Libya]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Ivory Coast]]. He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] when [[Amr Zaki]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar. In the final match, Aboutrika scored the decisive penalty in the shootout which gave Egypt the title.

Aboutrika led Al-Ahly to the [[2006 CAF Champions League]] title for the second successive time in November 2006. He was the top scorer of the competition with 8 goals, and scored the final match winning goal against [[CS Sfaxien]] in the 92nd minute.

He participated also with Al-Ahly in winning the [[CAF Super Cup]] against [[FAR Rabat]] of Morocco, days after the Africa Cup of Nations in February.

Locally, he got the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in June when he was the top scorer by 18 goals, and won [[Egypt Cup]], then the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] in July when he scored the winning goal against [[ENPPI]] in the 92nd minute despite having suffered an injury in the first half.

Japanese newspapers nominated Aboutrika to be one of the best players in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan, the last tournament in Aboutrika's great year. Al-Ahly was one of the African representatives, and the first team ever to be qualified two successive times to this championship, and the first African team to win a medal in that competition.

In the opening match of the tournament against [[Auckland City FC]] of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2-0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by stroking a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team. As well as netting with his delightful right-foot effort, Aboutrika was at the heart of most his side's best moves, dictating the rhythm with his skill and vision.

In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly faced Brazilian [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] on 13 December 2006, and Aboutrika played a good game, but his accurate shot hit the Brazilian right-hand post to deprive his team from a deserved draw. Al-Ahly lost the match 2-1, but proved a good efficiency, yet the ball refused to be netted in many available chances to score in Brazilian goalkeeper.[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/CWC/CWCMatchReport/0,4734,CWC-2006-2-01,00.html 'Match Report']

Al-Ahly faced [[Club América]] of Mexico, for the third place, and Aboutrika gave Al-Ahly the lead with an amazing free-kick over the wall, ending the first half 1-0 for Al-Ahly. In the second half, America made the draw, but as usual, Aboutrika appeared in the 79th minute with a skilled ball, he showed yet again why he is on the shortlist for the African player of the year. After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.

Aboutrika won all the competitions he participated in this year, and got the bronze medal for Al-Ahly in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]]. He was the top scorer in three competitions, which are [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] with 3 goals, [[Egyptian Premier League]] with 18 goals and [[2006 CAF Champions League]] with 8 goals. Aboutrika scored in other competitions, and made brilliant assistants to strikers.

Aboutrika said in November 2006: &quot;I would love to be nominated for the CAF Best Player award. That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika was the only African based player between nominees, but he is also the only one who made an achievement for his national team this year by winning [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations 2006]]. Aboutrika's brace in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and his dazzling performances throughout the season made him a serious contender for the CAF African Footballer of the Year award (as well as the BBC one) and secured his standing as Egypt's most popular personality. He did not win the prize but got second place and later was given &quot;best inter-club player&quot; and &quot;best player in the [[CAF Champions League]].&quot;

&quot;Aboutrika has won the highest prize any person can achieve, that is the love of the people,&quot; sports columnist Hassan Mistikawi wrote in the top-selling state-owned ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' daily.

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;. José sees Aboutrika as one of the best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: &quot;Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't imagine my team without him&quot;.

Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aboutrika's career ==

=== 2005-2009 ===
In the first part of Shosho league 2005-2006, Shehab scored many Goals goals for His Team. He was offered a position in Egypt's and one of Africa's top football teams, FC Shosho. He scored many goals in his first and only in little appearances with FC Shosho in 2005-2006 league, coming in the First place between top scorers in the Egyptian League with 100 goals.

Since 2004 when he joined Al-Ahly Club, Aboutrika has scored 11 goals in the Egypt Derby against [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]], which is the top record of goals,after him comes emad moteab with 10 goals

Aboutrika's efforts with Ahly led to attention from the Egyptian national team, and he debuted against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in a friendly match before the World Cup 2006 qualifiers on 31 March 2004 in [[Arab Contractors Stadium]]. His debut game ended 2-1 for the Egyptians. He started as an attacker, but was found to play better when he played his normal position behind the attackers in the midfield position. Aboutrika scored his first national goal in this game. He scored 5 goals in his first 6 appearances with Egypt.

=== 2005 ===
In 2005, Al-Ahly regained the [[Egyptian League]] Championship after four years out of top position, Aboutrika came in the third place between topscorers in the Egyptian League with 9 goals, and helped his team mate [[Emad Moteab]] to be the top scorer of competition. Also in 2005, Aboutrika played a great role in Al-Ahly victory of the [[2005 CAF Champions League]], he scored an amazing goal in the final with an outrageous effort from 30 yards out against [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of Tunisia in a game ended 3-0 for Al-Ahly.

Al-Ahly qualified for [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]] but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: &quot;Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan&quot;.

Before Japan, with Aboutrika on board, Al-Ahly was about to make a new world record for the longest winning-streak for a football club. Some have commented that the combination with [[Emad Moteab]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]] formed the most formidable triangle in African Soccer, and they were given the moniker of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Angolan striker [[Flávio Amado]] replaces Barakat sometimes, playing a great role in forming this dangerous triangle.

=== 2006 ===
He proved to be his international team's trump card en route to victory in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] in February, when he scored two important goals against [[Libya national football team|Libya]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Ivory Coast]]. He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] when [[Amr Zaki]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar. In the final match, Aboutrika scored the decisive penalty in the shootout which gave Egypt the title.

Aboutrika led Al-Ahly to the [[2006 CAF Champions League]] title for the second successive time in November 2006. He was the top scorer of the competition with 8 goals, and scored the final match winning goal against [[CS Sfaxien]] in the 92nd minute.

He participated also with Al-Ahly in winning the [[CAF Super Cup]] against [[FAR Rabat]] of Morocco, days after the Africa Cup of Nations in February.

Locally, he got the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in June when he was the top scorer by 18 goals, and won [[Egypt Cup]], then the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] in July when he scored the winning goal against [[ENPPI]] in the 92nd minute despite having suffered an injury in the first half.

Japanese newspapers nominated Aboutrika to be one of the best players in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan, the last tournament in Aboutrika's great year. Al-Ahly was one of the African representatives, and the first team ever to be qualified two successive times to this championship, and the first African team to win a medal in that competition.

In the opening match of the tournament against [[Auckland City FC]] of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2-0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by stroking a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team. As well as netting with his delightful right-foot effort, Aboutrika was at the heart of most his side's best moves, dictating the rhythm with his skill and vision.

In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly faced Brazilian [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] on 13 December 2006, and Aboutrika played a good game, but his accurate shot hit the Brazilian right-hand post to deprive his team from a deserved draw. Al-Ahly lost the match 2-1, but proved a good efficiency, yet the ball refused to be netted in many available chances to score in Brazilian goalkeeper.[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/CWC/CWCMatchReport/0,4734,CWC-2006-2-01,00.html 'Match Report']

Al-Ahly faced [[Club América]] of Mexico, for the third place, and Aboutrika gave Al-Ahly the lead with an amazing free-kick over the wall, ending the first half 1-0 for Al-Ahly. In the second half, America made the draw, but as usual, Aboutrika appeared in the 79th minute with a skilled ball, he showed yet again why he is on the shortlist for the African player of the year. After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.

Aboutrika won all the competitions he participated in this year, and got the bronze medal for Al-Ahly in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]]. He was the top scorer in three competitions, which are [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] with 3 goals, [[Egyptian Premier League]] with 18 goals and [[2006 CAF Champions League]] with 8 goals. Aboutrika scored in other competitions, and made brilliant assistants to strikers.

=== African Footballer of the Year 2006 Nomination ===
Aboutrika, who is Egypt's newest idol according to the FIFA.com expression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL | title =Egypt's new idol | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070102013139/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated to win the 2006 CAF [[African Footballer of the Year]] award along with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] striker [[Didier Drogba]] and [[FC Barcelona]] forward [[Samuel Eto'o]]. The other nominees for the honour were [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] international midfielder [[Michael Essien]], who plays for English Giants [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and Nigeria's [[Nwankwo Kanu]], who has twice grabbed the award. Aboutrika said in November 2006: &quot;I would love to be nominated for the CAF Best Player award. That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika was the only African based player between nominees, but he is also the only one who made an achievement for his national team this year by winning [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations 2006]]. Aboutrika's brace in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and his dazzling performances throughout the season made him a serious contender for the CAF African Footballer of the Year award (as well as the BBC one) and secured his standing as Egypt's most popular personality. He did not win the prize but got second place and later was given &quot;best inter-club player&quot; and &quot;best player in the [[CAF Champions League]].&quot;

&quot;Aboutrika has won the highest prize any person can achieve, that is the love of the people,&quot; sports columnist Hassan Mistikawi wrote in the top-selling state-owned ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' daily.

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;. José sees Aboutrika as one of the best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: &quot;Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't imagine my team without him&quot;.

=== 2007 ===
In 2007, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Premier League]] (2006–2007) for the third successive season. Aboutrika scored 7 goals for his team, although he was injured. Al-Ahly won the [[Egypt Cup]] 2007 for the second successive time. Aboutrika was the top goalscorer of the competition with 4 goals. He scored a double kick memorable goal against [[Tala'ea El-Gaish SC]] in the 8-round game which ended 3-1 for Al-Ahly. In the final, Al-Ahly faced his rival [[Zamalek SC]]. Aboutrika made a one neck-saving equalizer in the last 2 minutes on 2 July 2007 in the [[Egypt Cup]] resulting in extra-time after tying 2-2. After El-Zamalek grabbed their third in the first half of extra-time, Aboutrika dazzeled the stands with two great balls, one an assisted cross over the whites' defense to [[Osama Hosny]] to score the equalizer in second half of extra-time in the first seconds of the game and within a minute, he surged between the Zamalek's midfield and passed two Zamalek players before providing an accurate through pass to [[Ahmad Sedik]] on the wing who went through on goal and assisted again for [[Osama Hosny]] for the late winner and holding high the Egyptian Cup. After that, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] 2007 for the third successive time, through shootouts, after tying 1-1 with [[Ismaily SC|Ismaily]].

In [[2007 CAF Champions League]], Aboutrika scored 4 goals for Al-Ahly until now, to raise his African goals to the number 15. Al-Ahly faced [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of [[Tunisia]] in the final match. Al-Ahly was having the chance to be the first team in the World to reach [[FIFA Club World Cup]] three successive times, and the first team in Africa to win [[CAF Champions League]] three successive times. However, the two legs ended seeing [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of Tunisia lifting the cup.

He won the title Best Player in Egypt for 2007 the fourth successive time after 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 setting a new Egyptian record.

=== 2008 ===
'''African Cup of Nations 2008'''

In 2008, Aboutrika scored 4 goals for Egypt in the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]]. He scored the winning goal against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] in the final match, helping Egypt to win the African Cup of Nations for the second consecutive tournament. Aboutrika also scored a goal in the semi-final against [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Ivory Coast]], and scored twice against [[Sudan national football team|Sudan]] in Egypt's group stage match.

In the previous tournament in [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|2006]], he scored the latest decisive penalty shootout in the final match against Ivory Coast to give Egypt the cup. With his team Al-Ahly of Egypt, Aboutrika was the hero of final matches again, through scoring a goal in the final match second leg both [[2006 CAF Champions League|2006]] and [[2005 CAF Champions League]] helping his team lift the continental cup.

Aboutrika nominated the best player in the in Ghana 2008 final match.

'''FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers'''

After the friendly match against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], Aboutrika had an injury which deprived him from being a member along the national team in the first 4 matches played in June, in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers]]. He marked his national return against [[DR Congo national football team|Congo DR]] in [[Kinshasa]] on 7 September 2008 scoring the winning goal for Egypt, to secure the Pharaohs' place in the second round of Qualifications. He scored another goal in his second match in the qualifiers against [[Djibouti national football team|Djibouti]].

'''Al-Ahly'''

Aboutrika has rehealed from injury in August, after missing the group stage start of [[2008 CAF Champions League]] with his team Al-Ahly. He marked his first participation in the group stage scoring the winning goal for Al-Ahly on 93rd minute against [[Dynamos F.C.]] of [[Zimbabwe]] in a 8 round game ended 2-1 for the Egyptian side.
On 30 August, he helped Al-Ahly to grab the 3 points from [[Zimbabwe]], after making the winning goal, scored by his favourite teammate [[Mohamed Barakat]]. Al-Ahly achieved 1-0 win. On 14 September, Aboutrika scored the second goal for Al-Ahly against the rivals [[Zamalek SC]] of Egypt, in a group game ended 2-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.cafonline.com/?lng=1&amp;module=media&amp;cmpt=0&amp;idrub=97915&amp;idnews=83636| title = Aboutraika rescues Ahly in Cairo derby stalemate| accessdate =2008-09-15 | publisher =CAFONLINE.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika scored again in the final group match against [[ASEC Mimosas]] of [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivory Coast]], a game ended 2-2 as Aboutrika netted the first goal for Al-Ahly. A draw sealed first place in Group A for Al-Ahly with 12 points from six matches while Dynamos of Zimbabwe joined them in the semi-finals of the 3.5-million-dollar competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/newsid=886488.html#asec+back+twice+hold+Ahly| title = ASEC hit back twice to hold Ahly| accessdate =2008-09-22 | publisher =FIFA.com | language = }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Ahly of Egypt clashed with [[Enyimba International F.C.]] of [[Nigeria]] in the semi-final, the first leg of which was held on 5 October in [[Aba, Abia|Aba, Nigeria]], and ended with a draw 0-0. The second leg held on 18 October in [[Cairo]] and ended 1-0 for Al-Ahly.

Al Ahly faced [[Coton Sport FC de Garoua]] from Cameroon in the final, the first leg of which was held on 2 November and ended 2-0 for the Egyptian side. Al Ahly drew 2-2 with [[Coton Sport FC de Garoua|Coton Sport]] in Cameroon to complete a 4-2 aggregate victory and lift the [[CAF Champions League]] trophy for a record sixth time; a result which ensured they will compete at the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] for the third time in four years.

'''Confederations Cup 2009'''

Aboutrika was a member in Egypt football national team line-up in [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. Egypt falls in Group B along with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]].

Egypt started with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on 15 June, a game ended 4-3 for the Brazilian side. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's two goals, to his team mate [[Mohamed Zidan]] who scored twice.

The Italian sports journalist [[Gabriele Marcotti]] has also been highly impressed with Aboutrika's performance against Brazil, and praised Aboutrika's career with football in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Or, in fact, should he be admired for remaining loyal to his homeland, simply being happy with what he has achieved and not feeling the need to chase the glamour and millions of the Premier League or La Liga?''. }}

Egypt faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 18 June, a game ended with a victory 1-0 for Egypt. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's goal, to his team mate [[Mohamed Soliman|Mohamed Soliman &quot;Homos&quot;]] who scored with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 4 July, Aboutrika played in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Rwanda national football team|Rwanda]] in [[Egypt]], helping the Egyptians win 3-0, and scored the first and the third goal, making the Egyptian team second after [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], in their group. Aboutrika reached his fifth goal in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers]].

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Ahly qualified for [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]] but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: &quot;Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan&quot;.

Before Japan, with Aboutrika on board, Al-Ahly was about to make a new world record for the longest winning-streak for a football club. Some have commented that the combination with [[Emad Moteab]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]] formed the most formidable triangle in African Soccer, and they were given the moniker of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Angolan striker [[Flávio Amado]] replaces Barakat sometimes, playing a great role in forming this dangerous triangle.

=== 2006 ===
He proved to be his international team's trump card en route to victory in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] in February, when he scored two important goals against [[Libya national football team|Libya]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Ivory Coast]]. He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] when [[Amr Zaki]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar. In the final match, Aboutrika scored the decisive penalty in the shootout which gave Egypt the title.

Aboutrika led Al-Ahly to the [[2006 CAF Champions League]] title for the second successive time in November 2006. He was the top scorer of the competition with 8 goals, and scored the final match winning goal against [[CS Sfaxien]] in the 92nd minute.

He participated also with Al-Ahly in winning the [[CAF Super Cup]] against [[FAR Rabat]] of Morocco, days after the Africa Cup of Nations in February.

Locally, he got the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in June when he was the top scorer by 18 goals, and won [[Egypt Cup]], then the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] in July when he scored the winning goal against [[ENPPI]] in the 92nd minute despite having suffered an injury in the first half.

Japanese newspapers nominated Aboutrika to be one of the best players in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan, the last tournament in Aboutrika's great year. Al-Ahly was one of the African representatives, and the first team ever to be qualified two successive times to this championship, and the first African team to win a medal in that competition.

In the opening match of the tournament against [[Auckland City FC]] of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2-0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by stroking a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team. As well as netting with his delightful right-foot effort, Aboutrika was at the heart of most his side's best moves, dictating the rhythm with his skill and vision.

In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly faced Brazilian [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] on 13 December 2006, and Aboutrika played a good game, but his accurate shot hit the Brazilian right-hand post to deprive his team from a deserved draw. Al-Ahly lost the match 2-1, but proved a good efficiency, yet the ball refused to be netted in many available chances to score in Brazilian goalkeeper.[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/CWC/CWCMatchReport/0,4734,CWC-2006-2-01,00.html 'Match Report']

Al-Ahly faced [[Club América]] of Mexico, for the third place, and Aboutrika gave Al-Ahly the lead with an amazing free-kick over the wall, ending the first half 1-0 for Al-Ahly. In the second half, America made the draw, but as usual, Aboutrika appeared in the 79th minute with a skilled ball, he showed yet again why he is on the shortlist for the African player of the year. After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.

Aboutrika won all the competitions he participated in this year, and got the bronze medal for Al-Ahly in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]]. He was the top scorer in three competitions, which are [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] with 3 goals, [[Egyptian Premier League]] with 18 goals and [[2006 CAF Champions League]] with 8 goals. Aboutrika scored in other competitions, and made brilliant assistants to strikers.

=== African Footballer of the Year 2006 Nomination ===
Aboutrika, who is Egypt's newest idol according to the FIFA.com expression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL | title =Egypt's new idol | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070102013139/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated to win the 2006 CAF [[African Footballer of the Year]] award along with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] striker [[Didier Drogba]] and [[FC Barcelona]] forward [[Samuel Eto'o]]. The other nominees for the honour were [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] international midfielder [[Michael Essien]], who plays for English Giants [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and Nigeria's [[Nwankwo Kanu]], who has twice grabbed the award. Aboutrika said in November 2006: &quot;I would love to be nominated for the CAF Best Player award. That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika was the only African based player between nominees, but he is also the only one who made an achievement for his national team this year by winning [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations 2006]]. Aboutrika's brace in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and his dazzling performances throughout the season made him a serious contender for the CAF African Footballer of the Year award (as well as the BBC one) and secured his standing as Egypt's most popular personality. He did not win the prize but got second place and later was given &quot;best inter-club player&quot; and &quot;best player in the [[CAF Champions League]].&quot;

&quot;Aboutrika has won the highest prize any person can achieve, that is the love of the people,&quot; sports columnist Hassan Mistikawi wrote in the top-selling state-owned ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' daily.

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;. José sees Aboutrika as one of the best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: &quot;Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't imagine my team without him&quot;.

=== 2007 ===
In 2007, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Premier League]] (2006–2007) for the third successive season. Aboutrika scored 7 goals for his team, although he was injured. Al-Ahly won the [[Egypt Cup]] 2007 for the second successive time. Aboutrika was the top goalscorer of the competition with 4 goals. He scored a double kick memorable goal against [[Tala'ea El-Gaish SC]] in the 8-round game which ended 3-1 for Al-Ahly. In the final, Al-Ahly faced his rival [[Zamalek SC]]. Aboutrika made a one neck-saving equalizer in the last 2 minutes on 2 July 2007 in the [[Egypt Cup]] resulting in extra-time after tying 2-2. After El-Zamalek grabbed their third in the first half of extra-time, Aboutrika dazzeled the stands with two great balls, one an assisted cross over the whites' defense to [[Osama Hosny]] to score the equalizer in second half of extra-time in the first seconds of the game and within a minute, he surged between the Zamalek's midfield and passed two Zamalek players before providing an accurate through pass to [[Ahmad Sedik]] on the wing who went through on goal and assisted again for [[Osama Hosny]] for the late winner and holding high the Egyptian Cup. After that, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] 2007 for the third successive time, through shootouts, after tying 1-1 with [[Ismaily SC|Ismaily]].

In [[2007 CAF Champions League]], Aboutrika scored 4 goals for Al-Ahly until now, to raise his African goals to the number 15. Al-Ahly faced [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of [[Tunisia]] in the final match. Al-Ahly was having the chance to be the first team in the World to reach [[FIFA Club World Cup]] three successive times, and the first team in Africa to win [[CAF Champions League]] three successive times. However, the two legs ended seeing [[Étoile Sportive du Sahel]] of Tunisia lifting the cup.

Egypt faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 18 June, a game ended with a victory 1-0 for Egypt. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's goal, to his team mate [[Mohamed Soliman|Mohamed Soliman &quot;Homos&quot;]] who scored with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Al-Ahly regained the [[Egyptian League]] Championship after four years out of top position, Aboutrika came in the third place between topscorers in the Egyptian League with 9 goals, and helped his team mate [[Emad Moteab]] to be the top scorer of competition.

Al-Ahly qualified for [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]] but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: &quot;Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan&quot;.

Before Japan, with Aboutrika on board, Al-Ahly was about to make a new world record for the longest winning-streak for a football club. Some have commented that the combination with [[Emad Moteab]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]] formed the most formidable triangle in African Soccer, and they were given the moniker of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Angolan striker [[Flávio Amado]] replaces Barakat sometimes, playing a great role in forming this dangerous triangle.

=== 2006 ===
He proved to be his international team's trump card en route to victory in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] in February, when he scored two important goals against [[Libya national football team|Libya]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Ivory Coast]]. He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] when [[Amr Zaki]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar. In the final match, Aboutrika scored the decisive penalty in the shootout which gave Egypt the title.

Aboutrika led Al-Ahly to the [[2006 CAF Champions League]] title for the second successive time in November 2006. He was the top scorer of the competition with 8 goals, and scored the final match winning goal against [[CS Sfaxien]] in the 92nd minute.

He participated also with Al-Ahly in winning the [[CAF Super Cup]] against [[FAR Rabat]] of Morocco, days after the Africa Cup of Nations in February.

Locally, he got the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in June when he was the top scorer by 18 goals, and won [[Egypt Cup]], then the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] in July when he scored the winning goal against [[ENPPI]] in the 92nd minute despite having suffered an injury in the first half.

Japanese newspapers nominated Aboutrika to be one of the best players in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan, the last tournament in Aboutrika's great year. Al-Ahly was one of the African representatives, and the first team ever to be qualified two successive times to this championship, and the first African team to win a medal in that competition.

In the opening match of the tournament against [[Auckland City FC]] of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2-0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by stroking a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team. As well as netting with his delightful right-foot effort, Aboutrika was at the heart of most his side's best moves, dictating the rhythm with his skill and vision.

In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly faced Brazilian [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] on 13 December 2006, and Aboutrika played a good game, but his accurate shot hit the Brazilian right-hand post to deprive his team from a deserved draw. Al-Ahly lost the match 2-1, but proved a good efficiency, yet the ball refused to be netted in many available chances to score in Brazilian goalkeeper.[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/CWC/CWCMatchReport/0,4734,CWC-2006-2-01,00.html 'Match Report']

Al-Ahly faced [[Club América]] of Mexico, for the third place, and Aboutrika gave Al-Ahly the lead with an amazing free-kick over the wall, ending the first half 1-0 for Al-Ahly. In the second half, America made the draw, but as usual, Aboutrika appeared in the 79th minute with a skilled ball, he showed yet again why he is on the shortlist for the African player of the year. After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.

Aboutrika won all the competitions he participated in this year, and got the bronze medal for Al-Ahly in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]].

Aboutrika said in November 2006: &quot;I would love to be nominated for the CAF Best Player award. That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Aboutrika has won the highest prize any person can achieve, that is the love of the people,&quot; sports columnist Hassan Mistikawi wrote in the top-selling state-owned ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' daily.

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;. José sees Aboutrika as one of the best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: &quot;Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't imagine my team without him&quot;.

'''FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers'''

On 7 June, Aboutrika scored in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in [[Algeria]] but Egypt lost 3-1.

On 4 July, Aboutrika played in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Rwanda national football team|Rwanda]] in [[Egypt]], helping the Egyptians win 3-0, and scored the first and the third goal, making the Egyptian team second after [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], in their group. Aboutrika reached his fifth goal in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers]].

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2005-2009 ===
In the first part of Shosho league 2005-2006, Shehab scored many Goals goals for His Team. He was offered a position in Egypt's and one of Africa's top football teams, FC Shosho. He scored many goals in his first and only in little appearances with FC Shosho in 2005-2006 league, coming in the First place between top scorers in the Egyptian League with 100 goals.

Since 2005 when he joined Shosho Club, Shehab has scored 100 goals in the Egypt Derby against, which is the top record of goals,after him comes Ahmed Ashraf with 80 goals

Shehab's efforts with FC Shosho led to attention from the Egyptian national team, and he debuted against [Taa3alteam] in a friendly match before the World Cup 2006 qualifiers on 31 March 2004 in [[Arab Contractors Stadium]]. His debut game ended 5-2 for the Shosho's. He started as an attacker, but was found to play better when he played his normal position In Front of  the attackers in the Forward. Shehab scored his first national goal in this game. He scored 5 goals in his first 2 appearances with Shosho.

In 2005, FC Shosho regained the [[Egyptian League]] Championship after four years out of top position, Shehab came in the First place between topscorers in the Egyptian League with 100 goals, and helped his team mate [[Ahmed Ashraf]] to be the top scorer of competition.

FC Shosho qualified for [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]] but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: &quot;Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan&quot;.

Before Japan, with shehab on board, FC Shosho was about to make a new world record for the longest winning-streak for a football club. Some have commented that the combination with [[Ahmed Ashraf]] and [[Belal Elabnoudy]] formed the most formidable triangle in African Soccer, and they were given the moniker of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Egyptian striker [[Abdo Zalata]] replaces Belal sometimes, playing a great role in forming this dangerous triangle.

=== 2006 ===
He proved to be his international team's trump card en route to victory in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] in February, when he scored two important goals against [[Another Team]] and [[Another Team]]. He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Real Madrid]] when [[Moamen]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar. In the final match, Shehab scored the decisive penalty in the shootout which gave Shosho the title.

Shehab led FC Shosho to the [[2006 CAF Champions League]] title for the second successive time in November 2006. He was the top scorer of the competition with 5 goals, and scored the final match winning goal against [[Cote v'pvaur]] in the 92nd minute.

He participated also with FC Shosho in winning the [[CAF Super Cup]], days after the Africa Cup of Nations in February.

Locally, he got the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in June when he was the top scorer by 18 goals, and won [[Egypt Cup]], then the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] in July when he scored the winning goal against [[ENPPI]] in the 92nd minute despite having suffered an injury in the first half.

Japanese newspapers nominated Aboutrika to be one of the best players in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan, the last tournament in Aboutrika's great year. Al-Ahly was one of the African representatives, and the first team ever to be qualified two successive times to this championship, and the first African team to win a medal in that competition.

In the opening match of the tournament against [[Auckland City FC]] of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2-0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by stroking a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team. As well as netting with his delightful right-foot effort, Aboutrika was at the heart of most his side's best moves, dictating the rhythm with his skill and vision.

In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly faced Brazilian [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] on 13 December 2006, and Aboutrika played a good game, but his accurate shot hit the Brazilian right-hand post to deprive his team from a deserved draw. Al-Ahly lost the match 2-1, but proved a good efficiency, yet the ball refused to be netted in many available chances to score in Brazilian goalkeeper.[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/CWC/CWCMatchReport/0,4734,CWC-2006-2-01,00.html 'Match Report']

Al-Ahly faced [[Club América]] of Mexico, for the third place, and Aboutrika gave Al-Ahly the lead with an amazing free-kick over the wall, ending the first half 1-0 for Al-Ahly. In the second half, America made the draw, but as usual, Aboutrika appeared in the 79th minute with a skilled ball, he showed yet again why he is on the shortlist for the African player of the year. After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.

Aboutrika won all the competitions he participated in this year, and got the bronze medal for Al-Ahly in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]]. He was the top scorer in three competitions, which are [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] with 3 goals, [[Egyptian Premier League]] with 18 goals and [[2006 CAF Champions League]] with 8 goals. Aboutrika scored in other competitions, and made brilliant assistants to strikers.

=== African Footballer of the Year 2006 Nomination ===
Aboutrika, who is Egypt's newest idol according to the FIFA.com expression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL | title =Egypt's new idol | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070102013139/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated to win the 2006 CAF [[African Footballer of the Year]] award along with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] striker [[Didier Drogba]] and [[FC Barcelona]] forward [[Samuel Eto'o]]. The other nominees for the honour were [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] international midfielder [[Michael Essien]], who plays for English Giants [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and Nigeria's [[Nwankwo Kanu]], who has twice grabbed the award. Aboutrika said in November 2006: &quot;I would love to be nominated for the CAF Best Player award. That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika was the only African based player between nominees, but he is also the only one who made an achievement for his national team this year by winning [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations 2006]]. Aboutrika's brace in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and his dazzling performances throughout the season made him a serious contender for the CAF African Footballer of the Year award (as well as the BBC one) and secured his standing as Egypt's most popular personality. He did not win the prize but got second place and later was given &quot;best inter-club player&quot; and &quot;best player in the [[CAF Champions League]].&quot;

&quot;Aboutrika has won the highest prize any person can achieve, that is the love of the people,&quot; sports columnist Hassan Mistikawi wrote in the top-selling state-owned ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' daily.

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;.

Egypt faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 18 June, a game ended with a victory 1-0 for Egypt. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's goal, to his team mate [[Mohamed Soliman|Mohamed Soliman &quot;Homos&quot;]] who scored with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Real Madrid]] when [[Moamen]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar.

After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit.

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FC Shosho qualified for [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]] but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: &quot;Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan&quot;.

Before Japan, with shehab on board, FC Shosho was about to make a new world record for the longest winning-streak for a football club. Some have commented that the combination with [[Ahmed Ashraf]] and [[Belal Elabnoudy]] formed the most formidable triangle in African Soccer, and they were given the moniker of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Egyptian striker [[Abdo Zalata]] replaces Belal sometimes, playing a great role in forming this dangerous triangle.

=== 2006 ===
He proved to be his international team's trump card en route to victory in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] in February, when he scored two important goals against [[Another Team]] and [[Another Team]]. He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Real Madrid]] when [[Moamen]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar.

Japanese newspapers nominated Aboutrika to be one of the best players in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan, the last tournament in Aboutrika's great year. Al-Ahly was one of the African representatives, and the first team ever to be qualified two successive times to this championship, and the first African team to win a medal in that competition.

In the opening match of the tournament against [[Auckland City FC]] of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2-0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by stroking a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team.

In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly faced Brazilian [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] on 13 December 2006, and Aboutrika played a good game, but his accurate shot hit the Brazilian right-hand post to deprive his team from a deserved draw. Al-Ahly lost the match 2-1, but proved a good efficiency, yet the ball refused to be netted in many available chances to score in Brazilian goalkeeper.[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/CWC/CWCMatchReport/0,4734,CWC-2006-2-01,00.html 'Match Report']

In the second half, America made the draw, but as usual, Aboutrika appeared in the 79th minute with a skilled ball, he showed yet again why he is on the shortlist for the African player of the year. After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.

Aboutrika said in November 2006: &quot;I would love to be nominated for the CAF Best Player award. That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;. José sees Aboutrika as one of the best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: &quot;Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't imagine my team without him&quot;.

=== 2009 ===
'''Confederations Cup 2009'''

Aboutrika was a member in Egypt football national team line-up in [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. Egypt falls in Group B along with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]].

Egypt started with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on 15 June, a game ended 4-3 for the Brazilian side. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's two goals, to his team mate [[Mohamed Zidan]] who scored twice.

The Italian sports journalist [[Gabriele Marcotti]] has also been highly impressed with Aboutrika's performance against Brazil, and praised Aboutrika's career with football in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Or, in fact, should he be admired for remaining loyal to his homeland, simply being happy with what he has achieved and not feeling the need to chase the glamour and millions of the Premier League or La Liga?''. }}

Egypt faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 18 June, a game ended with a victory 1-0 for Egypt. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's goal, to his team mate [[Mohamed Soliman|Mohamed Soliman &quot;Homos&quot;]] who scored with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers'''

On 7 June, Aboutrika scored in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in [[Algeria]] but Egypt lost 3-1.

On 4 July, Aboutrika played in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Rwanda national football team|Rwanda]] in [[Egypt]], helping the Egyptians win 3-0, and scored the first and the third goal, making the Egyptian team second after [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], in their group. Aboutrika reached his fifth goal in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers]].

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FC Shosho qualified for [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]] but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: &quot;Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan&quot;.

Before Japan, with shehab on board, FC Shosho was about to make a new world record for the longest winning-streak for a football club. Some have commented that the combination with [[Ahmed Ashraf]] and [[Belal Elabnoudy]] formed the most formidable triangle in African Soccer, and they were given the moniker of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Egyptian striker [[Abdo Zalata]] replaces Belal sometimes, playing a great role in forming this dangerous triangle.

=== 2006 ===
He proved to be his international team's trump card en route to victory in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] in February, when he scored two important goals against [[Another Team]] and [[Another Team]]. He was the winning goal assistant, in the Semi-final match against [[Real Madrid]] when [[Moamen]] scored in the 80th minute. He was very dominant in that game, but his accurate shot hit the bar. In the final match, Shehab scored the decisive penalty in the shootout which gave Shosho the title.

Shehab led FC Shosho to the [[2006 CAF Champions League]] title for the second successive time in November 2006. He was the top scorer of the competition with 5 goals, and scored the final match winning goal against [[Cote v'pvaur]] in the 92nd minute.

Japanese newspapers nominated Aboutrika to be one of the best players in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] in Japan, the last tournament in Aboutrika's great year. Al-Ahly was one of the African representatives, and the first team ever to be qualified two successive times to this championship, and the first African team to win a medal in that competition.

In the opening match of the tournament against [[Auckland City FC]] of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2-0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by stroking a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team. As well as netting with his delightful right-foot effort, Aboutrika was at the heart of most his side's best moves, dictating the rhythm with his skill and vision.

In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly faced Brazilian [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] on 13 December 2006, and Aboutrika played a good game, but his accurate shot hit the Brazilian right-hand post to deprive his team from a deserved draw. Al-Ahly lost the match 2-1, but proved a good efficiency, yet the ball refused to be netted in many available chances to score in Brazilian goalkeeper.[http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/CWC/CWCMatchReport/0,4734,CWC-2006-2-01,00.html 'Match Report']

Al-Ahly faced [[Club América]] of Mexico, for the third place, and Aboutrika gave Al-Ahly the lead with an amazing free-kick over the wall, ending the first half 1-0 for Al-Ahly. In the second half, America made the draw, but as usual, Aboutrika appeared in the 79th minute with a skilled ball, he showed yet again why he is on the shortlist for the African player of the year. After surging out of midfield and finding [[Flavio Amado]] with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball and calmly slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit. Personally, he became the top scorer of tournament by 3 goals in 3 matches.

Aboutrika won all the competitions he participated in this year, and got the bronze medal for Al-Ahly in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]]. He was the top scorer in three competitions, which are [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] with 3 goals, [[Egyptian Premier League]] with 18 goals and [[2006 CAF Champions League]] with 8 goals. Aboutrika scored in other competitions, and made brilliant assistants to strikers.

=== African Footballer of the Year 2006 Nomination ===
Aboutrika, who is Egypt's newest idol according to the FIFA.com expression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL | title =Egypt's new idol | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070102013139/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated to win the 2006 CAF [[African Footballer of the Year]] award along with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] striker [[Didier Drogba]] and [[FC Barcelona]] forward [[Samuel Eto'o]]. The other nominees for the honour were [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] international midfielder [[Michael Essien]], who plays for English Giants [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and Nigeria's [[Nwankwo Kanu]], who has twice grabbed the award. Aboutrika said in November 2006: &quot;I would love to be nominated for the CAF Best Player award. That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika was the only African based player between nominees, but he is also the only one who made an achievement for his national team this year by winning [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations 2006]]. Aboutrika's brace in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and his dazzling performances throughout the season made him a serious contender for the CAF African Footballer of the Year award (as well as the BBC one) and secured his standing as Egypt's most popular personality. He did not win the prize but got second place and later was given &quot;best inter-club player&quot; and &quot;best player in the [[CAF Champions League]].&quot;

&quot;Aboutrika has won the highest prize any person can achieve, that is the love of the people,&quot; sports columnist Hassan Mistikawi wrote in the top-selling state-owned ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' daily.

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;. José sees Aboutrika as one of the best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: &quot;Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't imagine my team without him&quot;.

=== 2007 ===
In 2007, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Premier League]] (2006–2007) for the third successive season. Aboutrika scored 7 goals for his team, although he was injured. Al-Ahly won the [[Egypt Cup]] 2007 for the second successive time. Aboutrika was the top goalscorer of the competition with 4 goals. He scored a double kick memorable goal against [[Tala'ea El-Gaish SC]] in the 8-round game which ended 3-1 for Al-Ahly. In the final, Al-Ahly faced his rival [[Zamalek SC]]. Aboutrika made a one neck-saving equalizer in the last 2 minutes on 2 July 2007 in the [[Egypt Cup]] resulting in extra-time after tying 2-2. After El-Zamalek grabbed their third in the first half of extra-time, Aboutrika dazzeled the stands with two great balls, one an assisted cross over the whites' defense to [[Osama Hosny]] to score the equalizer in second half of extra-time in the first seconds of the game and within a minute, he surged between the Zamalek's midfield and passed two Zamalek players before providing an accurate through pass to [[Ahmad Sedik]] on the wing who went through on goal and assisted again for [[Osama Hosny]] for the late winner and holding high the Egyptian Cup. After that, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] 2007 for the third successive time, through shootouts, after tying 1-1 with [[Ismaily SC|Ismaily]].

Egypt faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 18 June, a game ended with a victory 1-0 for Egypt. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's goal, to his team mate [[Mohamed Soliman|Mohamed Soliman &quot;Homos&quot;]] who scored with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Aboutrika reached his fifth goal in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers]].

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate.

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers'''

On 7 June, Aboutrika scored in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in [[Algeria]] but Egypt lost 3-1.

On 4 July, Aboutrika played in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Rwanda national football team|Rwanda]] in [[Egypt]], helping the Egyptians win 3-0, and scored the first and the third goal, making the Egyptian team second after [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], in their group. Aboutrika reached his fifth goal in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers]].

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August, he helped Al-Ahly to grab the 3 points from [[Zimbabwe]], after making the winning goal, scored by his favourite teammate [[Mohamed Barakat]]. Al-Ahly achieved 1-0 win. On 14 September, Aboutrika scored the second goal for Al-Ahly against the rivals [[Zamalek SC]] of Egypt, in a group game ended 2-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.cafonline.com/?lng=1&amp;module=media&amp;cmpt=0&amp;idrub=97915&amp;idnews=83636| title = Aboutraika rescues Ahly in Cairo derby stalemate| accessdate =2008-09-15 | publisher =CAFONLINE.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika scored again in the final group match against [[ASEC Mimosas]] of [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivory Coast]], a game ended 2-2 as Aboutrika netted the first goal for Al-Ahly. A draw sealed first place in Group A for Al-Ahly with 12 points from six matches while Dynamos of Zimbabwe joined them in the semi-finals of the 3.5-million-dollar competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/newsid=886488.html#asec+back+twice+hold+Ahly| title = ASEC hit back twice to hold Ahly| accessdate =2008-09-22 | publisher =FIFA.com | language = }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Ahly of Egypt clashed with [[Enyimba International F.C.]] of [[Nigeria]] in the semi-final, the first leg of which was held on 5 October in [[Aba, Abia|Aba, Nigeria]], and ended with a draw 0-0. The second leg held on 18 October in [[Cairo]] and ended 1-0 for Al-Ahly.

Al Ahly faced [[Coton Sport FC de Garoua]] from Cameroon in the final, the first leg of which was held on 2 November and ended 2-0 for the Egyptian side. Al Ahly drew 2-2 with [[Coton Sport FC de Garoua|Coton Sport]] in Cameroon to complete a 4-2 aggregate victory and lift the [[CAF Champions League]] trophy for a record sixth time; a result which ensured they will compete at the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] for the third time in four years.

=== 2009 ===
'''Confederations Cup 2009'''

Aboutrika was a member in Egypt football national team line-up in [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. Egypt falls in Group B along with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]].

Egypt started with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on 15 June, a game ended 4-3 for the Brazilian side. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's two goals, to his team mate [[Mohamed Zidan]] who scored twice.

The Italian sports journalist [[Gabriele Marcotti]] has also been highly impressed with Aboutrika's performance against Brazil, and praised Aboutrika's career with football in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Or, in fact, should he be admired for remaining loyal to his homeland, simply being happy with what he has achieved and not feeling the need to chase the glamour and millions of the Premier League or La Liga?''. }}

Egypt faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 18 June, a game ended with a victory 1-0 for Egypt. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's goal, to his team mate [[Mohamed Soliman|Mohamed Soliman &quot;Homos&quot;]] who scored with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 4 July, Aboutrika played in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Rwanda national football team|Rwanda]] in [[Egypt]], helping the Egyptians win 3-0, and scored the first and the third goal, making the Egyptian team second after [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], in their group. Aboutrika reached his fifth goal in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers]].

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika, who is Egypt's newest idol according to the FIFA.com expression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL | title =Egypt's new idol | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070102013139/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/interview/0,4323,117442-N,00.htmL &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated to win the 2006 CAF [[African Footballer of the Year]] award along with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] striker [[Didier Drogba]] and [[FC Barcelona]] forward [[Samuel Eto'o]]. The other nominees for the honour were [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] international midfielder [[Michael Essien]], who plays for English Giants [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and Nigeria's [[Nwankwo Kanu]], who has twice grabbed the award. Aboutrika said in November 2006: &quot;I would love to be nominated for the CAF Best Player award. That would make 2006 a very special year!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html | title =Aboutrika's uphill struggle | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =FIFA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206174712/http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,125215,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika was the only African based player between nominees, but he is also the only one who made an achievement for his national team this year by winning [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations 2006]]. Aboutrika's brace in [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and his dazzling performances throughout the season made him a serious contender for the CAF African Footballer of the Year award (as well as the BBC one) and secured his standing as Egypt's most popular personality. He did not win the prize but got second place and later was given &quot;best inter-club player&quot; and &quot;best player in the [[CAF Champions League]].&quot;

&quot;Aboutrika has won the highest prize any person can achieve, that is the love of the people,&quot; sports columnist Hassan Mistikawi wrote in the top-selling state-owned ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' daily.

Al-Ahly Portuguese coach [[Manuel José de Jesus]] describes Aboutrika as &quot;the best football player in Africa&quot;. He said that Aboutrika has more and more skills that did not appear in Japan. He said: &quot;Aboutrika didn't introduce all what he has in FIFA Club World Cup 2006, but he got the top scorer title and helped leading his team to the third place&quot;. José sees Aboutrika as one of the best players he ever trained. He assured this meaning saying: &quot;Aboutrika is priceless for us. I can't imagine my team without him&quot;.

=== 2007 ===
In 2007, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Premier League]] (2006–2007) for the third successive season. Aboutrika scored 7 goals for his team, although he was injured.

He scored a double kick memorable goal against [[Tala'ea El-Gaish SC]] in the 8-round game which ended 3-1 for Al-Ahly. In the final, Al-Ahly faced his rival [[Zamalek SC]]. Aboutrika made a one neck-saving equalizer in the last 2 minutes on 2 July 2007 in the [[Egypt Cup]] resulting in extra-time after tying 2-2. After El-Zamalek grabbed their third in the first half of extra-time, Aboutrika dazzeled the stands with two great balls, one an assisted cross over the whites' defense to [[Osama Hosny]] to score the equalizer in second half of extra-time in the first seconds of the game and within a minute, he surged between the Zamalek's midfield and passed two Zamalek players before providing an accurate through pass to [[Ahmad Sedik]] on the wing who went through on goal and assisted again for [[Osama Hosny]] for the late winner and holding high the Egyptian Cup. After that, Al-Ahly won the [[Egyptian Super Cup]] 2007 for the third successive time, through shootouts, after tying 1-1 with [[Ismaily SC|Ismaily]].

Or, in fact, should he be admired for remaining loyal to his homeland, simply being happy with what he has achieved and not feeling the need to chase the glamour and millions of the Premier League or La Liga?''. }}

Egypt faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 18 June, a game ended with a victory 1-0 for Egypt. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's goal, to his team mate [[Mohamed Soliman|Mohamed Soliman &quot;Homos&quot;]] who scored with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 ===
'''Confederations Cup 2009'''

Aboutrika was a member in Egypt football national team line-up in [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. Egypt falls in Group B along with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]].

Egypt started with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on 15 June, a game ended 4-3 for the Brazilian side. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's two goals, to his team mate [[Mohamed Zidan]] who scored twice.

The Italian sports journalist [[Gabriele Marcotti]] has also been highly impressed with Aboutrika's performance against Brazil, and praised Aboutrika's career with football in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Or, in fact, should he be admired for remaining loyal to his homeland, simply being happy with what he has achieved and not feeling the need to chase the glamour and millions of the Premier League or La Liga?''. }}

Egypt faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 18 June, a game ended with a victory 1-0 for Egypt. Aboutrika assisted Egypt's goal, to his team mate [[Mohamed Soliman|Mohamed Soliman &quot;Homos&quot;]] who scored with a header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers'''

On 7 June, Aboutrika scored in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in [[Algeria]] but Egypt lost 3-1.

On 4 July, Aboutrika played in Egypt's world cup qualifier against [[Rwanda national football team|Rwanda]] in [[Egypt]], helping the Egyptians win 3-0, and scored the first and the third goal, making the Egyptian team second after [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], in their group. Aboutrika reached his fifth goal in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifiers]].

=== 2012 ===

'''Port Said Stadium Disaster'''

After the [[Port Said Stadium disaster]], on 1 February 2012, Aboutrika decided to retire from professional football, along with [[Emad Motaeb]] and [[Mohamed Barakat]], then he decided to get back to football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9057194/Egypt-football-riots-three-Egypt-internationals-retire-after-mass-deaths-in-stadium-riot.html|title=Egypt football riots: three Egypt internationals retire after mass deaths in stadium riot|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-02|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eddydove.blogspot.com/2012/02/cult-of-aboutrika.html|title=The Cult of Aboutrika|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, the Egyptian Premier League had been cancelled. Aboutrika had finished the uncompleted campaign with 4 goals in 14 games.

'''CAF Champions League'''

On 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1-0 at home to [[Stade Malien]] in a second leg [[CAF Champions League]] match and were down 2-0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for [[Mohamed Shawky]] and in the second half, he scored his first every CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from a wonderfully curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the [[2012 CAF Champions League group stage]].

'''London 2012'''

Aboutrika was one of the three overage players participated with [[Egypt national under-23 football team|Egypt]] in [[London 2012]], and was the team's captain. Aboutrika scored Egypt's first goal in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|tournament]] against [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]] in a loss 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london2012.com/football/event/men/match=fbm400c02/index.html|title=Men's Football - Olympic Football - London 2012|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-26|publisher=London 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second game, Aboutrika's assist for [[Mohamed Salah]] picked a 1-1 draw against [[New Zealand national under-23 football team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/80501/egypt-u-23-vs-new-zealand-u-23/report|title=Egypt 1-1 New Zealand 2012|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-07-29|publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third game against [[Belarus national under-23 football team|Belarus]], Aboutrika assisted a goal for [[Mohamed Salah]] and scored another to help Egypt win 3-1 and claim a quarter-final berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/matches/round=256009/match=300197681/index.html?intcmp=livecoverage_box_mensolympic_en|title=Egypt 3-1 Belarus 2012|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-01|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt qualifying for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, six months to the day after being devastated by [[Port Said Stadium disaster]]. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team’s captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. “Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying,” he recalled. “They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mensolympic/news/newsid=1674613/|title=Aboutrika draws inspiration from tragedy|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting Ultras Ahlawy'''

Breaking with the tradition of soccer players standing on the sidelines of popular revolts in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], if not supporting autocratic leaders, Aboutrika announced late that he would not be joining his fellow [[Al Ahly]] players on 9 September in [[Egypt Super Cup]] final against [[ENPPI]], Egypt’s first domestic match since this month’s lifting of a seven-month ban on professional soccer.

In doing so Aboutrika one of Egypt’s most popular players, sided with [[Ultras Ahlawy]], the cub’s militant, highly politicized, well organized, street-battle hardened support group. The group opposes the resumption of soccer as long as justice has not been done for the 74 Ahly supporters who were killed in February Egypt’s worst sporting incident in a politically loaded brawl in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and fans are not allowed to attend matches.

The brawl, which widely is believed to have been provoked by security forces in a bid to punish the ultras for their key role in the ousting of president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and violent opposition to the military that ruled Egypt until the election in July of president [[Mohammed Morsi]] in the country’s first democratic poll, sparked the banning of soccer for most of this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.eurasiareview.com/08092012-striker-abou-treika-a-symbol-of-egypts-convoluted-political-transition-analysis/ | title =Striker Abou-Treika: A Symbol Of Egypt’s Convoluted Political Transition| accessdate =2012-09-09 | publisher = Eurasia Review| language = | location= | first=James | last=M.Dorsy | date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Aboutrika is a graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor of arts degree in [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/gabriele_marcotti/article6506805.ece?Submitted=true | title =Mohamed Abotreka shows he belongs in highest company| accessdate =2009-06-16 | publisher = Times Online| language = | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti | date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has twins, Ahmed and Seif, and Roqaya.

After winning the title of [[African Champions League]] 2006 for Al-Ahly, he gave a declaration which had been chosen by many newspapers and programs as 'The Declaration of the year'. When newspapers reporters praised him and his goal which they considered the main reason for winning the tournament, he replied, &quot;We need to stop this habit of praising a definite player. It isn't Aboutrika, but the whole team who got the Cup. Without the others' efforts, I can't ever make anything. Football is a game played by many players, it isn't [[Tennis]] or [[Squash (sport)|Squash]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Hassan El-Shazli, the former famous Egyptian player, was the first one to discover Aboutrika's talent and develop it. He narrates a story about Aboutrika's manners when he was in [[Tersana]]. He said that when the chairman of Tersana club wanted Aboutrika and a team-mate defender to sign their new contracts, he put a very high salary for Aboutrika compared to that of his team-mate but Aboutrika refused to sign, and insisted to take the same salary as his team-mate although it was much lower. El-Shazli's attempts failed to persuade Aboutrika that his role for the club is much greater than this defender, and finally, Aboutrika insisted on equality and signed his contract as lower as his team-mate.

As his soccer star status grew in Africa, he turned his sights to humanitarian issues. Aboutrika says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Every athlete has a humanitarian role in society. He doesn't live solely for himself, but for others too. I like to participate in charity work and try my best to help the poor and penniless. I'm also seeking to use soccer in humanitarian work.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on that idea, Aboutrika joined [[UNDP]] Goodwill Ambassadors the Brazilian player [[Ronaldo]], and French player, [[Zinedine Zidane]], in addition to 40 international soccer stars in 2005 for a ‘Match Against Poverty’ in Germany, with the aim of raising funds and increasing awareness about the issue worldwide. He scored in that match.

“In that humanitarian match, sports people said ‘no to poverty’ in one strong voice, standing up to beat it once and for all,&quot; Aboutrika explains. The match was held in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany with the support of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association [[FIFA]].

One of Aboutrika’s soccer role models, is the Egyptian player, [[Mahmoud El Khatib]]. Meanwhile, off the pitch he follows the example of the Prophet [[Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2149 | title =Egyptian footballer Abotreka plays against hunger | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered to appear in a WFP 30-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) in which he draws attention to the tragic fact that 25,000 people die from hunger every day, 18,000 of them children.

“Hunger takes away a child every five seconds. We have to move immediately and lend each other a hand because every second counts. This is a game we have to win,” Aboutrika said in the PSA. The PSA is being aired on Middle Eastern TV stations which are broadcasting it for free.

Aboutrika is a [[WFP]] Ambassador Against Hunger. He believes that poverty is a double-edged sword, as it can either give rise to feelings of despair, or help the poor person to persevere and be determined. Aboutrika wishes that all those who suffer from despair could develop determination and face their difficulties with strength.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

&quot;[[Islam]] deals with the problem of poverty through [[zakat]] (spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the poor or needy), where the rich feel the plight of the poor,&quot; says Aboutrika. &quot;We have to help the poor as much as we can so that they don’t feel alienated in their own society&quot; he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2284 | title =Mohammad Abotreka scoring against poverty | accessdate =2006-12-09 | publisher =wfp.org | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika volunteered for another PSA in Egypt, for helping children with [[cancer]]. He made it for free, and donated funds to help build a hospital for them.

In January 2007, Aboutrika led the Blood Donation Campaign held by Egyptian Ministry of Health. He appeared in PSAs for free and donated with his blood.

=== Sympathy with Gaza ===
After scoring a goal in Egypt's 3-0 over [[Sudan]] in the 2008 [[African Cup of Nations]]
Aboutrika removed his jersey to show a T-shirt reading &quot;Sympathize with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]&quot;. He was protesting against [[Israel]]'s 10-day blockade of Gaza. He was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] for breaking [[FIFA]]'s rule against displaying political slogans during play, and was said to face possible further sanctions, but finally [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] made no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/608715 | title =Egypt's Aboutrika in Gaza Slogan Trouble | accessdate =2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboutrika initially did not want to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown. He said that his action was a personal statement from himself, as he feels much sympathy for the children of [[Gaza]] Strip who are under siege. He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface. In the months and years since the Carrie Brown/Aboutrika interview, much has been made as to the true meanings of Aboutrika's statement.

Some Arab commentators describes this yellow card as a 'honourable punishment' for any athlete. In Gaza, Palestinian people went out, raising Aboutrika's photos thanking him and appreciating his act. The same scene was replied after the final match, when Aboutrika scored the winning goal for Egypt, many Palestinians went out to celebrate the victory and singing for Aboutrika. Al-Hilal club in the Gaza Strip made an honouring ceremony for Aboutrika where youth team players lift flags reading &quot;Palestine loves Aboutrika &quot;, &quot;Aboutrika is my idol&quot;, &quot;Aboutrika, the humanitarian player..Gaza won't forget you&quot; and &quot;Aboutrika, an example of freedom and dignity&quot;. Youth team players were wearing Aboutrika 's No22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.Al-Ahly.com/Sitemanager/templates/egy.aspx?articleid=7701&amp;zoneid=6 | title =Palestine celebrates Aboutrika | accessdate =2008-02-04 | publisher =Al-Ahly.com | language =ar }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Profile ==
Mr. Moosa (Sappe') completed his studies in the UK and holds an Honours degree in Mechanical Engineering (B Eng. 1995) from University of Glasgow (UK) and a Masters of Philosophy in Engineering degree in Metallurgy and Materials (M Phil Eng. 1997) from the University of Birmingham (UK).

He also formed a private consultancy firm in Maldives, A Company Private Limited, in 1999. The operations of the A Company stopped in October 2003, because of his move to the UK fearing arrest due to his criticism of the current Maldivian government in an interview given to the BBC that month, since then he has given many interviews to several international media outlets [Google Search].  'A Company' carried out several projects for Villa Group, Cyprea, Sun Travels &amp; Tours, DIMMS, MITSUI and several other prominent companies. Services provided by the Company included consultancy work in Engineering, Material Science, Civil Engineering, Law, Marketing and Business as well as Internet and IT.

Mr. Moosa's aim is to play an active role in the economic, social and political development of the Maldives and hopes that the youth and work force will emulate his achievements and aspirations. He believes that education is the key to success, prosperity and better life, the platform for a strong connected society. Mr. Moosa also worked as Director of Business Development and E-Commerce for Sun Travels &amp; Tours Private Limited, one of the largest tour operator in the Maldives and owner of Vilu Reef Beach &amp; Spa and Olhuveli Beach &amp; Spa. He was also a consultant for Villa Shipping &amp; Trading Company, the largest private company in the Maldives, operating more than 5 resorts and a major player in other key economic sectors. He also worked as a consultant for other companies such as Travelin Maldives Private Limited, Aqua Sun Maldives Private Limited, Capital Travel &amp; Tours Private Limited and TBI  

Mr. Moosa is the founder and Editor in Chief of Dhivehi Observer News Website - www.dhivehiobserver.com

 Mr. Moosa is a founding member of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), which was formed in exile in November 2003. He was an elected member of the first 15-member General Council of the Party. However, due to his task of being Editor of Dhivehi Observer News website (www.dhivehiobserver.com) he did not hold any elected position in the party but continues to work closely with party leadership on promoting democracy and respect for human rights in the Maldives, both of which have been undermined by the brutal and dictatorial regime of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom since 1978.

Maldivian Democratic Party won the first ever Presidential election held in October 2008.

Mr. Moosa was appointed as President's Envoy for Science &amp; Technology on 11th March 2009. In the wake of the political turmoil and the subsequent resignation of President Nasheed on 7th February 2012, Mr. Moosa followed suit and left the Government.

During his time in the Government, Mr. Moosa represented Maldives at the World Bank Climate Investment Fund, Asia Solar Energey Forum (ADB). Mr. Moosa was also elected for two consecutive terms as Co-Chair of the Climate Investment Fund - Strategic Climate Funds in 2010-2011. www.climateinvestmentfunds.org

Mr. Moosa is also a founding member of South Asian Network For Security and Climate Change (SANSaC - www.sansac.org), an international Think Tank.

Mr. Moosa is currently the Chief Commercial Officer of Atoll Paradise Private Limited - www.atollparadise.com, an award winning luxury travel company based in the Maldives.

Dhivehi Observer is famous in the Maldives for the key role it played in exposing the dictatorship of Gayyoom from its launch in 2004. It is also by enlarge credited as a major force in bringing press freedom

Mr. Moosa has published scientific papers in the Journal of Polymer Testing and Journal of Cellular Plastics. His pastimes include reading, writing, philosophy, football, billiards and music.

Mr. Moosa's biography has been recorded in the Marquis Who's Who of Emerging Leaders 2007 (First Edition) as well as in the new edition of 'Who's Who in Asia' in recognition for the work he has done as a journalist, by founding Dhivehi Observer as a major source of news and information for the Maldivian public in general, who have been deprived of real news for many many years by state controlled media.

&quot;The Internet is the medium of choice for people who want to write freely - any educated person with internet access in male' will start the day by reading the Dhivehi Observer (www.dhivehiobserver.com), a tabloid run from exile in the UK by modern-day fold hero Ahmed Moosa, known to one and all as Sappe'. Irreverent, hard-hitting and a self-declared anti-Gayoom site, the Dhivehi Observer is what anyone wanting to know the truth about the Maldives read as a matter of urgency, written as it is by anonymous sources throughout the country. Other great Internet sites include the UK-based Minivan News (www.minivannews.com), which is also a radio station serving the Maldives when it's not jammed.&quot; - Lonely Planet Maldives 2006

== Personal life ==
Ahmed Moosa is married with 5 children.

Moosa is the President's Envoy for Science and Technology. He was appointed on 11 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/maldives-aims-to-become-first-carbonneutral-country-1644907.html ''The Independent'' &quot;Maldives aims to become first carbon-neutral country&quot;, 14 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is amongst those who campaigned for democracy and human rights which led to the end of the 30 year rule of [[Gayoom]] in November 2008. He is the founder and editor in chief of the news website Dhivehi Observer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com ''Dhivehi Observer'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html ''Dhivehi Observer:About Us'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is a senior member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to its first General Council. He was a widely outspoken critic of the former president [[Gayoom]]. He lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003 - 2008. The opposition Coalition won the Presidential Election held in October 2008.

Moosa is normally resident in [[Glasgow]], United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 2003 and has three sons from that marriage. He married secondly Fathimath Moosa, with whom he has a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Pvt Ltd. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], former finance minister and leader of the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I. Moosa, Personal Details]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa was also a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondary education at the [[Malé English School]], Malé. In 1990 he  acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a B. Eng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in  metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
In 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]], covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/15/wmald15.xml ''The Telegraph'' &quot;UK police warn wife of Maldives policeman over threat&quot;, 15 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 2003 and has three sons from that marriage. He married secondly Fathimath Moosa, with whom he has a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Pvt Ltd. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], Chairman of Villa Shipping and Trading Company, the largest private company in the Maldives. He is the Leaderof the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I.

On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a B. Eng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of ruggy]] acquiring PhD (engineering) in  metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
In 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]], covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day-to-day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London.

The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], Chairman of Villa Shipping and Trading Company, the largest private company in the Maldives. He is the Leaderof the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I. Moosa, Personal Details]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa was also a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondary education at the [[Malé English School]], Malé. In 1990 he  acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a B. Eng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in  metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
On 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]], covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day-to-day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/15/wmald15.xml ''The Telegraph'' &quot;UK police warn wife of Maldives policeman over threat&quot;, 15 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 1995 and had three sons from that marriage: Adam, Michael and Daniel. He married secondly Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Pvt Ltd. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], Chairman of Villa Shipping and Trading Company, the largest private company in the Maldives. He is the leader of the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I.

On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a B. Eng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in  metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
On 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life, the end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]] covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to the [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if he remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day-to-day operations of the party for two reasons. That is, MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''', also known as '''Sappé''', is a Maldivian editor-in-chief and politican who served as the first Envoy for Science and Technology to be appointed by the first democratically elected [[president of the Maldives]], [[Mohamed Nasheed]]. He was appointed to his position on 11 March 2009 and resigned from the Maldivian government on 9 February 2012, soon after President Nasheed's government was allegedly overthrown by the incumbent President [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan]] two days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/maldives-aims-to-become-first-carbonneutral-country-1644907.html ''The Independent'' &quot;Maldives aims to become first carbon-neutral country&quot;, 14 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/07/mohamed-nasheed-resigns-maldives-president ''The Guarding'' &quot;Mohamed Nasheed resigns as Maldives President&quot;, 7 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa is amongst those who campaigned for democracy and [[human rights]] which led to the end of the 30 year rule of [[Gayoom]] in November 2008. He is the founder and [[editor-in-chief]] of the news website ''Dhivehi Observer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com ''Dhivehi Observer'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html ''Dhivehi Observer:About Us'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is a senior member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to its first General Council. He was a widely outspoken critic of the former president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. He lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003-2008. The opposition Coalition won the [[Maldivian presidential election, 2008|Presidential Election held in October 2008]].

Moosa resides in [[Glasgow]], United Kingdom as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2009/12/1111143 ''Scotland-Maldives Partnership&quot;, 11 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 1995 and had three sons from that marriage: Adam, Michael and Daniel. He married secondly Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Pvt Ltd. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], Chairman of Villa Shipping and Trading Company, the largest private company in the Maldives. He is the leader of the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I. Moosa, Personal Details]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa was also a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

==Education==
Moosa completed his secondary education at the [[Malé English School]], Malé. In 1990 he  acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a B. Eng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in  metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
On 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life, the end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]] covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to the [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if he remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day-to-day operations of the party for two reasons. That is, MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/15/wmald15.xml ''The Telegraph'' &quot;UK police warn wife of Maldives policeman over threat&quot;, 15 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''', also known as '''Sappé''', is a Maldivian editor-in-chief and politican who served as the first Envoy for Science and Technology to be appointed by the first democratically elected [[president of the Maldives]], [[Mohamed Nasheed]]. He was appointed to his position on 11 March 2009 and resigned from the Maldivian government on 9 February 2012, soon after President Nasheed's government was allegedly overthrown by the incumbent President [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan]] two days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/maldives-aims-to-become-first-carbonneutral-country-1644907.html ''The Independent'' &quot;Maldives aims to become first carbon-neutral country&quot;, 14 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/07/mohamed-nasheed-resigns-maldives-president ''The Guarding'' &quot;Mohamed Nasheed resigns as Maldives President&quot;, 7 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa is amongst those who campaigned for democracy and [[human rights]] which led to the end of the 30 year rule of [[Gayoom]] in November 2008. He is the founder and [[editor-in-chief]] of the news website ''Dhivehi Observer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com ''Dhivehi Observer'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html ''Dhivehi Observer:About Us'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is a senior member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to its first General Council. He was a widely outspoken critic of the former president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. He lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003-2008. The opposition Coalition won the [[Maldivian presidential election, 2008|Presidential Election held in October 2008]].

Moosa resides in [[Glasgow]], United Kingdom as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2009/12/1111143 ''Scotland-Maldives Partnership&quot;, 11 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 1995 and had three sons from that marriage: Adam, Michael and Daniel. He married secondly Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Pvt Ltd. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], Chairman of Villa Shipping and Trading Company, the largest private company in the Maldives. He is the leader of the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I. Moosa, Personal Details]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa was also a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

==Education==
Moosa completed his secondary education at the [[Malé English School]], Malé. In 1990 he  acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a B. Eng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in  metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
On 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life, the end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]] covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to the [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if he remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day-to-day operations of the party for two reasons. That is, MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/15/wmald15.xml ''The Telegraph'' &quot;UK police warn wife of Maldives policeman over threat&quot;, 15 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''', also known as '''Sappé''', is a Maldivian editor-in-chief and politician who served as the first Envoy for Science and Technology to be appointed by the first democratically elected [[president of the Maldives]], [[Mohamed Nasheed]]. He was appointed to his position on 11 March 2009 and resigned from the Maldivian government on 9 February 2012, soon after President Nasheed's government was allegedly overthrown by the incumbent President [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan]] two days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/maldives-aims-to-become-first-carbonneutral-country-1644907.html ''The Independent'' &quot;Maldives aims to become first carbon-neutral country&quot;, 14 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/mohamed-nasheed-resigns-maldives-president ''The Guarding'' &quot;Mohamed Nasheed resigns as Maldives President&quot;, 7 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa is amongst those who campaigned for democracy and [[human rights]] which led to the end of the 30 year rule of [[Gayoom]] in November 2008. He is the founder and [[editor-in-chief]] of the news website ''Dhivehi Observer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com ''Dhivehi Observer'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html ''Dhivehi Observer:About Us'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is a senior member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to its first General Council. He was a widely outspoken critic of the former president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. He lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003-2008. The opposition Coalition won the [[Maldivian presidential election, 2008|Presidential Election held in October 2008]].

Moosa resides in [[Glasgow]], United Kingdom as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2009/12/1111143 ''Scotland-Maldives Partnership&quot;, 11 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 1995 and had three sons from that marriage: Adam, Michael and Daniel. He married secondly Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Pvt Ltd. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], Chairman of Villa Shipping and Trading Company, the largest private company in the Maldives. He is the leader of the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I. Moosa, Personal Details]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa was also a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

==Education==
Moosa completed his secondary education at the [[Malé English School]], Malé. In 1990 he  acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a B. Eng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in  metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
On 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi (Kaafu Atoll)|Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life, the end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]] covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to the [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if he remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day-to-day operations of the party for two reasons. That is, MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/15/wmald15.xml ''The Telegraph'' &quot;UK police warn wife of Maldives policeman over threat&quot;, 15 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''', also known as '''Sappé''', is a Maldivian editor-in-chief and politician who served as the first Envoy for Science and Technology to be appointed by the first democratically elected [[president of the Maldives]], [[Mohamed Nasheed]]. He was appointed to his position on 11 March 2009 and resigned from the Maldivian government on 9 February 2012, soon after President Nasheed's government was allegedly overthrown by the incumbent President [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan]] two days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/maldives-aims-to-become-first-carbonneutral-country-1644907.html ''The Independent'' &quot;Maldives aims to become first carbon-neutral country&quot;, 14 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/mohamed-nasheed-resigns-maldives-president ''The Guarding'' &quot;Mohamed Nasheed resigns as Maldives President&quot;, 7 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa is amongst those who campaigned for democracy and [[human rights]] which led to the end of the 30 year rule of [[Gayoom]] in November 2008. He is the founder and [[editor-in-chief]] of the news website ''Dhivehi Observer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com ''Dhivehi Observer'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html ''Dhivehi Observer:About Us''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514045711/http://dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html |date=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is a senior member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to its first General Council. He was a widely outspoken critic of the former president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. He lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003-2008. The opposition Coalition won the [[Maldivian presidential election, 2008|Presidential Election held in October 2008]].

Moosa resides in [[Glasgow]], United Kingdom as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2009/12/1111143 ''Scotland-Maldives Partnership&quot;, 11 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 1995 and had three sons from that marriage: Adam, Michael and Daniel. He married secondly Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Pvt Ltd. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], Chairman of Villa Shipping and Trading Company, the largest private company in the Maldives. He is the leader of the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I. Moosa, Personal Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410175944/http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm |date=10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa was also a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

==Education==
Moosa completed his secondary education at the [[Malé English School]], Malé. In 1990 he  acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a B. Eng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in  metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
On 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi (Kaafu Atoll)|Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life, the end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]] covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to the [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if he remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day-to-day operations of the party for two reasons. That is, MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/15/wmald15.xml ''The Telegraph'' &quot;UK police warn wife of Maldives policeman over threat&quot;, 15 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''', also known as '''Sappé''', is a Maldivian editor-in-chief and politician who served as the first Envoy for Science and Technology to be appointed by the first democratically elected [[president of the Maldives]], [[Mohamed Nasheed]]. He was appointed to his position on 11 March 2009 and resigned from the Maldivian government on 9 February 2012, soon after President Nasheed's government was allegedly overthrown by the incumbent President [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan]] two days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/maldives-aims-to-become-first-carbonneutral-country-1644907.html ''The Independent'' &quot;Maldives aims to become first carbon-neutral country&quot;, 14 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/mohamed-nasheed-resigns-maldives-president ''The Guarding'' &quot;Mohamed Nasheed resigns as Maldives President&quot;, 7 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa is amongst those who campaigned for democracy and [[human rights]] which led to the end of the 30-year rule of [[Gayoom]] in November 2008. He is the founder and [[editor-in-chief]] of the news website ''Dhivehi Observer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com ''Dhivehi Observer'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html ''Dhivehi Observer:About Us''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514045711/http://dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html |date=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is a senior member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to its first General Council. He was a widely outspoken critic of the former president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. He lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003–2008. The opposition Coalition won the [[2008 Maldivian presidential election|Presidential Election held in October 2008]].

Moosa resides in [[Glasgow]], United Kingdom as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2009/12/1111143 ''Scotland-Maldives Partnership&quot;, 11 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 1995 and had three sons from that marriage: Adam, Michael and Daniel. He married secondly Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Pvt Ltd. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design, printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], Chairman of Villa Shipping and Trading Company, the largest private company in the Maldives. He is the leader of the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I. Moosa, Personal Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410175944/http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm |date=10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa was also a director of [http://www.horizonfisheries.com/ Horizon Fisheries Private Limited], a company with majority shares owned by Qasim Ibraim and former DRP member of parliament, Ahmed Nashid (ADK).

==Education==
Moosa completed his secondary education at the [[Malé English School]], Malé. In 1990 he acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from [[Asmai Secondary School]], [[Kuwait]]. On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a BEng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
On 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi (Kaafu Atoll)|Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life, the end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]] covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to the [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if he remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day-to-day operations of the party for two reasons. That is, MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312213458/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/15/wmald15.xml ''The Telegraph'' &quot;UK police warn wife of Maldives policeman over threat&quot;, 15 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day-to-day operations of the party for two reasons. That is, MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2006%2F09%2F15%2Fwmald15.xml |title=''The Telegraph'' &quot;UK police warn wife of Maldives policeman over threat&quot;, 15 September 2006 |access-date=12 March 2007 |archive-date=12 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312213458/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2006%2F09%2F15%2Fwmald15.xml |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''', also known as '''Sappé''', is a Maldivian editor-in-chief and politician who served as the first Envoy for Science and Technology to be appointed by the first democratically elected [[president of the Maldives]], [[Mohamed Nasheed]]. He was appointed to his position on 11 March 2009 and resigned from the Maldivian government on 9 February 2012, soon after President Nasheed's government was allegedly overthrown by the incumbent President [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan]] two days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/maldives-aims-to-become-first-carbonneutral-country-1644907.html ''The Independent'' &quot;Maldives aims to become first carbon-neutral country&quot;, 14 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/mohamed-nasheed-resigns-maldives-president ''The Guarding'' &quot;Mohamed Nasheed resigns as Maldives President&quot;, 7 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa is amongst those who campaigned for democracy and [[human rights]] which led to the end of the 30-year rule of [[Gayoom]] in November 2008. He is the founder and [[editor-in-chief]] of the news website ''Dhivehi Observer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com ''Dhivehi Observer'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html ''Dhivehi Observer:About Us''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514045711/http://dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html |date=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is a senior member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to its first General Council. He was a widely outspoken critic of the former president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. He lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003–2008. The opposition Coalition won the [[2008 Maldivian presidential election|Presidential Election held in October 2008]].

Moosa resides in [[Glasgow]], United Kingdom as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2009/12/1111143 ''Scotland-Maldives Partnership&quot;, 11 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 1995 and had three sons from that marriage: Adam, Michael and Daniel. He married secondly Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Pvt Ltd. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design, printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], Chairman of Villa Shipping and Trading Company, the largest private company in the Maldives. He is the leader of the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I.

==Education==
Moosa completed his secondary education at the [[Malé English School]], Malé. In 1990 he acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from [[Asmai Secondary School]], [[Kuwait]]. On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a BEng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
On 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi (Kaafu Atoll)|Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life, the end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]] covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to the [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if he remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], Chairman of Villa Shipping and Trading Company, the largest private company in the Maldives.

==Education==
Moosa completed his secondary education at the [[Malé English School]], Malé. In 1990 he acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from [[Asmai Secondary School]], [[Kuwait]]. On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a BEng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
On 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi (Kaafu Atoll)|Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life, the end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]] covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to the [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if he remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day-to-day operations of the party for two reasons. That is, MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2006%2F09%2F15%2Fwmald15.xml |title=''The Telegraph'' &quot;UK police warn wife of Maldives policeman over threat&quot;, 15 September 2006 |access-date=12 March 2007 |archive-date=12 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312213458/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2006%2F09%2F15%2Fwmald15.xml |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed to his position on 11 March 2009 and resigned from the Maldivian government on 9 February 2012, soon after President Nasheed's government was allegedly overthrown by the incumbent President [[Mohammed Waheed Hassan]] two days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/maldives-aims-to-become-first-carbonneutral-country-1644907.html ''The Independent'' &quot;Maldives aims to become first carbon-neutral country&quot;, 14 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/mohamed-nasheed-resigns-maldives-president ''The Guarding'' &quot;Mohamed Nasheed resigns as Maldives President&quot;, 7 February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Moosa is amongst those who campaigned for democracy and [[human rights]] which led to the end of the 30-year rule of [[Gayoom]] in November 2008. He is the founder and [[editor-in-chief]] of the news website ''Dhivehi Observer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com ''Dhivehi Observer'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html ''Dhivehi Observer:About Us''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514045711/http://dhivehiobserver.com/aboutus.html |date=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moosa is a senior member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] and was elected to its first General Council. He was a widely outspoken critic of the former president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. He lived in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family from 2003–2008. The opposition Coalition won the [[2008 Maldivian presidential election|Presidential Election held in October 2008]].

Moosa resides in [[Glasgow]], United Kingdom as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2009/12/1111143 ''Scotland-Maldives Partnership'', 11 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He first married in 1995 and had three sons from that marriage: Adam, Michael and Daniel. He married secondly Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter, Alexander and Enya. He later married Aminath Moosa and had a daughter, Emma.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Pvt Ltd. The company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design, printing and publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports.

Moosa was practically involved in designing and production of the election campaign material for [[Ilyas Ibrahim]] (brother-in-law of the president Gayyoom) in 1999 who ran against [[Mohamed Nasheed]] (of the opposition) for representing the people of [[Malé]] as a member of the parliament. &quot;I worked in Ilyas's last campaign (1999) on the request of Mr. Qasim Ibrahim which later turned out to be a regrettable experience.&quot; [http://www.minvanradio.com/do/maldives_statement_21Nov2004_dhivehiobserver.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

Since 1999 Moosa has been a consultant to [[Qasim Ibrahim]], Chairman of Villa Shipping and Trading Company, the largest private company in the Maldives. He is the leader of the [[Jumhooree Party]], which is part of the current government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/moosa/CV%20of%20ASIMoosa.htm ''Dhivehi Observer'' Ahmed S. I.

==Education==
Moosa completed his secondary education at the [[Malé English School]], Malé. In 1990 he acquired General Certificate of Education with distinction in all subjects, from [[Asmai Secondary School]], [[Kuwait]]. On 13 July 1995 he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with a BEng with honours in mechanical engineering. Two years later, in 1997, he graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring PhD (Engineering) in metallurgy and materials.

==Political career==
On 19 September 2003, [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi (Kaafu Atoll)|Maafushi]] jail was severely beaten up and ultimately paid with his life, the end result of a series of complicated disputes between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. The [[BBC]] covered this event and Moosa gave an interview to the BBC the following month and left Maldives, on 15 October 2003, to the [[United Kingdom]]. The interview was aired on 17 October 2003. He says he left the country because he believed he would be in danger if he remained in Maldives. &quot;I have already left the country fearing the worst&quot; said Sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on 10 November 2003, soon after its official announcement and was a member of its general council. However, he does not get involved with day-to-day operations of the party for two reasons. That is, MDP's major operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver, which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview with the BBC, he gave several other interviews. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government.

According to the article published on [[The Daily Telegraph]] on 15 September 2006, Ahmed Moosa was threatened via email by the wife of police commissioner [[Adam Zahir]], Husna Latheef, on 11 April 2005. Moosa filed a complaint to [[Wiltshire Police]] who investigated the death threat with the assistance of the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London. The threat was traced back to Husna Latheef's email and was issued with a first verbal warning under the Harassment Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2006%2F09%2F15%2Fwmald15.xml |title=''The Telegraph'' &quot;UK police warn wife of Maldives policeman over threat&quot;, 15 September 2006 |access-date=12 March 2007 |archive-date=12 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312213458/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2006%2F09%2F15%2Fwmald15.xml |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
